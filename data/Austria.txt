The Heartland of the
Holy Roman Empire
has endured the long period of the Great Interregnum, and looks to the future with grave concern. In the face of Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig IV. von Wittelsbach's advancing age, the families of von Wittelsbach, de Luxembourg, and von Habsburg once more prepare for competition over the crown. While Imperial authority south of the Alps is deteriorating, German merchants scramble to secure their trade routes into Italy, as the Hanseatic League relish their dominance over the region of Northern Germany.
Due to the diligent efforts of Duke Albrecht II. the Wise von Habsburg and his predecessors, Austria successfully expanded and solidified its rule in Lower Austria, Styria, and Carinthia. With their position on the south-eastern borders of the Holy Roman Empire secured, Austria can now look towards the grand prize the von Hasburg are determined to reclaim: the imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire.
Austria
is a South German duchy within the
Holy Roman Empire
. In 1337, it is among the larger constituents of the empire and is ruled by the
House of Habsburg

Starting position

Consisting of most of the south-east corner of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria is bordered by many nations, among them the powerful kingdoms of
Bohemia
and
Hungary
. It consists of Upper and Lower Austria, which follow the Danube river south of Bohemia, Styria, and several smaller territories scattered around Southern Germany. Originating as a march of the Kingdom of Bavaria in the late 900s, Austria historically consolidated further territories nearby such as Tyrol and what is now Slovenia, later inheriting the crowns of numerous kingdoms and incorporating them into the Austrian realm. Though Austria and the House of Habsburg focused on acquiring territory through strategic royal marriages, Austria's advantageous position allows the player to easily pursue a number of paths to become one of Europe's foremost great powers.
