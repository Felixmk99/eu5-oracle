At the start of the game most countries start with 30
Stability, 20
Prestige and 75 Government Power.
Gold
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Gold, or Ducats, represents liquid wealth. It is spent on almost everything, from constructing buildings to maintaining armies, and many costs are scaled by the country's income. Gold changes hands through the purchases and sales on the market. The main sources of gold income and expenses are the following:
Sources of income
Sources of expenses
Minting
Estate tax
Trade income
Selling food
Foreign buildings
Mercenary income
Positive diplomatic deals
Interests from loans (given)
Cost of the court
Army maintenance (min 50%)
Navy maintenance (min 50%)
Fort maintenance (min 50%)
Cost of colonies
Diplomatic spending
Stability spending
Exploration cost
Building subsidies
Mercenary paying
Negative diplomatic deals
Interests from loans (taken)
Buying food
Each location has a tax base, which is the combined profit of its R.G.O. and buildings selling their goods to the market as well as Burghers activities, multiplied by the control percentage in the location. The tax base of each location is distributed among the estates of its pops according to their relative population in the location. Then each estate pays a portion of it to the country according to the tax rate imposed on it.
Estate taxation can be automated, which will raise and lower estates tax until their Satisfaction Equilibrium is 50%.
Minting
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Minting is one of the primary ways of gaining additional ducats. It is set on a scale that ranges from 0% to 25% of the country's tax base and increases demand for
Gold and
Silver in the capital market by an equal amount. In addition, every country has a minting threshold, starting at 5%, and minting above the minting threshold will increase inflation.
Inflation
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Inflation represents the increase in all prices in the game. Each month inflation decreases by
-0.1%
and is increased by
+0.005
for each 1% minting above the minting threshold.
Gold and Silver also increase inflation but it depends on the total amount of a countries production that is precious metals. The calculation is: (Precious Metal Output)/(Total Country Output) x (1% inflation).
So if a country produces 10 precious metals and in total produce 20 goods the inflation gained would be
+0.5%
.
The Reduce Inflation cabinet action can be used to reduce inflation, which is unlocked with
Strict Monetary Control
advance
.
Expected expenses
[
edit

edit source
]
Every country is expected to pay three expenses. How much each country chooses to pay ranges from 0% to 100%. Paying them is optional but doing so grants various bonuses. Each expected expense scales with the country's tax base but the percentage can be increased or decreased by various factors.

[

Armies, navies and forts have a monthly influence cost, which by default it is set to be paid in full. It is possible to reduce the percentage of maintenance that is it paid for all three, but this will give penalties. Reducing the maintenance of armies or navies reduces their morale by an equal percentage. Reducing the maintenance of forts gives the following penalties for each 1% reduced:
−2%
Fort Defense
−0.5%
Garrison Size
−0.0005
Monthly Prestige
Loans
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Loans are instant sums of money that can be taken and must be monthly paid over the course of 60 months with interest. The base interest for every country is 10% and can range from 1% to 25%. The sum of all loans of a country is called the debt.
Left-clicking on the loan button will borrow money from the estates. There is a finite amount of gold that can be borrowed from estates.
Right-clicking on the loan button will borrow money from banking countries. A list of all banking countries within diplomatic range will appear. How big the loan is depends on how much the banking country can afford to lend.
If a country has negative gold at the end of a month, it will automatically take a loan. If there is not enough gold that can be borrowed, the country will become declare bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Bankruptcy can be declared while a country has loans, either manually from the Current Loans menu or automatically if the country has a negative balance and there is not enough gold that can be borrowed. Bankruptcy will remove all loans, reduce inflation and reset the country's gold to 1 but will also cost

Stability represents the internal peace of a country and ranges from
−100
to

Main article:
Control
The effective
Tax Base
of a location is calculated by multiplying the
Potential Tax Base
with the location's
Control
.
The current control of a location slowly trends towards its
Maximum Control
. The maximum control of a location is primarily determined by its Proximity to Capital, among other modifiers:
Proximity
:

Maximum control can also be temporarily increased by using the Increase Province Control cabinet action.
Tax
[
edit
|
edit source
]
A location's
Potential Tax Base
is calculated by adding the total profits from
RGO
, the sum of Potential Profits from buildings, and some factors involving Burghers trading
what?
.
The effective
Tax Base
is then calculated by multiplying the Potential Tax Base with the location's Control. The loss in tax base due to low control is not received by any parties.
The Tax Base is then divided among
Estates
, based on the local
Tax Base Share
. The Tax Base Share is the local population, weighted by
Estate
tax weight

Nobles
150
Clergy
25
Burghers
20
Peasants

Tribesmen
0.01
Note that the tax base weighting is different from the weighting used in Estate Power calculations.
After dividing up the Tax Base to each estate, it is taxed according to the national
tax rate
for each estate.
Example

At the start of the game in April 1337, León has a
Potential Tax Base of 7.26:

Total Potential Tax Base
7.26 potential tax base
Factoring in Control, we get
7.26 potential tax base *
42.82% control =
3.11 tax base.
Tax Base Share for each Estate is calculated using the population:

Finally, the tax generated from León can be calculated to match the tooltip:

Government power
[

Depending on its government type, each country has a government power resource, which represents how well its government functions and ranges from 0 to 100. Government power is spent on the same things regardless of which resource the country uses, but each type of government power provides different benefits.

Legitimacy
Legitimacy is a measure of how accepted the governance is by the population and estates in their Country. It is very much a prerequisite for running a country smoothly - at low levels we will find that nobody wants to work with us and rebellions may break out, attempting to install a Ruler that they find more palatable.

Republican Tradition
Republican Tradition measures how well Republicanism is entrenched in our country. Republican Tradition represents how strong the traditions are in a Republic. A Republic elects a new Ruler every couple of years and keeping the same Ruler over several elections will reduce our Republican Tradition. At low levels, it may collapse and revert to some kind of autocracy. For a well-functioning republic government, this measure should be kept high.

Manpower
[

edit source
]
Manpower represents the limit of how many blaggards and scoundrels a
Country
can support in its standing
Army
.
Manpower is expended when training and maintaining professional
Regiments
, which are usually more effective than
Army Levies
.
The rate at which Manpower is gained can be increased by constructing Manpower
Buildings
or researching certain
Advances
.
A country can store up to 5 years worth of their Manpower income.
Sailors
[
edit
|
edit source
]
A
Country
may possess a number of Sailors, representing the fishermen, merchant seamen, and naval officers who make a living on the open seas.
Such experienced tars are required to build
Ships
, and are expended while maintaining a
Navy
. These are separate from
Naval Levies
and more effective. They are even required to man
Exploration
missions.
The rate at which Sailors are gained can be increased by constructing port
Buildings
or researching certain
Advances
.
A country can store up to 5 years worth of their Sailors income.
Food
[
edit

edit source
]
Food
is a resources used by both armies and pops. Food is produced by:
Food raw materials
RGOs,
Laborer and Slave pops which are not employed, and
Villages buildings, which may directly produce food (Forest Village), or indirectly by producing food raw materials (Fishing Village).
The local
Food Productivity
modifies the amount of food produced at each location. The Local Food Production % takes into account:
Weather
(e.g. wind damage
-5%
, sandstorm
-15%
) and
Winter
(mild
-25%
, normal
-50%
, severe
-200%
)
Raised Levies
-20%
Location Rank (Rural Settlement
+10%
, Town

to

)
Peasants, Dhimmi, and Tribes
estate satisfaction
Laws
or Policies (e.g. Feudal Administration)
Advances
Bulidings
(e.g. Irrigation)
There are 3 layers involved in the production and distribution of food:
Local Food
: Local Food is produced and consumed in the Locations, and any excess or deficit is added to Provincial Food.
Provincial Food
: Provincial Food is a province-wide food storage, and any excess when it is full or deficit when it is empty is added to Market Food unless the province is under Siege. Armies will consume Provincial Food if they would otherwise suffer attrition. A province can only buy or sell as much food on the market as it can store in Provincial Food, regardless of Local Food production and consumption.
Market Food
: Market Food is a market-wide food storage. Food prices depends on the amount of Market Food present. Any food bought or sold on the market will affect the income of the location's owner. Market Food can be moved between markets via trades of food raw materials.
Every location has a food consumption that depends on its pops. If a location does not have food in any of the three layers, it will suffer starvation, which brings the following effects:
