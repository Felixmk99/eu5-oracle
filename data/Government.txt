has a Government of a specific
Government Type

Capital

Ruler

Societal Values

Government Reforms

Government types
[

edit source
]
Each country has a government type, which defines the inner structure of its government. The government type determines the Government Power resource used and the
succession laws
available, but also unlocks specific laws, government reforms, estate privileges, and advances.
Countries that are at peace, do not have a disaster and are not bankrupt or part of an Union can change their government type at the cost of 50
Stability and 25 Government Power. This will also change the country type to
Settled if not already. A very few formable countries will change government type when formed and some historical flavor events can change government type.
Papal States,
Yuán and countries that are electors or emperor of the Holy Roman Empire cannot change government.
Tribe and
Steppe Horde governments can only reform into
Monarchy
,
Republic
and
Theocracy governments can reform into each other.

Monarchy
A Monarchy is a Government Type based upon the principle of undivided personal sovereignty, where the Ruler is the first among the elites. The Heir is normally determined by the Dynasty of the Monarch and in most cases they rule for life.
Monarchs can use Royal Marriages to secure Alliances, and can even inherit foreign Countries through Personal Unions. However, succession is often a troublesome matter, and Monarchies may easily fall into Regencies or under the influence of foreign Dynasties.

Republic
A Republic is a Government Type where the Rulers are chosen by Elections to serve as the representants of the citizen body for a set period of time. Depending on the Succession Law the Ruler may belong to any of the Estates.
The strength of the political institutions makes Republics more resilient to inheritance issues, but the less personal nature of rule limits the diplomatic tools at their disposal. As such, Dynasties play a lesser role and Republics cannot benefit from Royal Marriages.

Steppe Horde
A Steppe Horde is a Government Type based upon on military power of its Ruler. Relatives of the current Ruler have a higher chance to become the Heir, but seniority and personal Abilities are also highly regarded.
Rulers are issued from the elite members of the society and will only keep the loyalty of their peers as long as they prove themselves capable of subjugating, razing, and plundering neighboring Countries. Because of that, succession is a momentous event for a Steppe Horde, and might even lead to collapse if the new Ruler fails to demonstrate its might.

Theocracy
A Theocracy is a Government Type based on the principle of divine sovereignty, where the Ruler is issued from the servants of the faith and secular matters are subordinated to religious authority.
Rulers are usually chosen to rule for life by some form of Election, which allows for a less disruptive transfer of power.

Tribe
A Tribe is a Government Type where the political power is structured first and foremost around the concept of kinship, be it by direct blood or perceived ancestry.
Dynasties and family ties are therefore of prime importance when determining the Heir, who will always belong to the elite members of society, but very frequently seniority, personal Abilities, and military prowess are also highly regarded.

Societal values

Societal values during the Age of Discovery
The societal values define the social and political structure of a
country
, the customs of its people and the characteristics of its legal body. Its effects can have a profound impact on how the country is played, and some advanced Government Reforms require specific combinations of Societal Values to be enacted. Societal values also play an important role in
diplomacy
, as countries with affine societal values will tend to have a higher Opinion of each other.
Each societal value is an axis with two opposite poles that can reach up to 100. A country's position on the axis is primarily influenced by laws, reforms, estate privileges, and cabinet actions, and it drifts slowly over time towards one of the two poles. The higher a societal value, the more factors are needed to push it further. Hovering over a societal value will display all currently available options of increasing it.
As a country progresses towards a societal value it will gain increasing bonuses and penalties, scaling from zero to the values displayed in the table below.

The Mysticism-Jurisprudence societal value axis is only available to countries that have a primary religion from the Islamic, Druze or Yazidi religion group. If a country changes its primary religion to another one that has the axis the progress will be saved, but if it changes its primary religion to one that does not have the axis and later again to one that has the axis, progress will start from the middle of the axis.

The cabinet of a kingdom
The Cabinet is the assembly of higher officials that help govern the country. Each country starts with 2 cabinet seats and the number can be increased by certain advances, the empire government rank. Appointing a cabinet member costs only a small amount of Gold but replacing a cabinet member costs 5
Stability. By default only male
characters
can be appointed to the cabinet but there are a few ways to change this.
Countries that do not have
Tribe government can promote one of its cabinet members to Head of Cabinet. This costs 10 times as much
Gold as appointing a cabinet member and also 5 Government Power. Having a Head of Cabinet increases the efficiency of the cabinet by
+25%
but the selected cabined member can no longer lead armies or navies or be removed from the cabinet and the Head of Cabinet cannot be changed until the current one dies.
If the Head of Cabinet belongs to an estate other than the
Crown, its estate will gain
+5%
Satisfaction and
+25%
Power.
If the Head of Cabinet belongs to the
Crown estate the country gains
+25%
Crown Power and
+0.02
Monthly Government Power.
Each member of the cabinet can be assigned to a cabinet action. These are performed either until they are finished, or cancelled.

Regency
[

edit source
]
A Regency starts when a country loses its ruler and either does not have a heir or the heir is a child. Under a regency the country will be ruled by a character known as the regent. The regency will continue until a proper ruler is available. Regencies caused because the ruler is underage will end when the ruler becomes an adult but can be extended by 5 years at any point at the cost of 20 Government Power. While a country has a regency each year there is a 20% chance for a regency-related event to trigger.
There are multiple types of regency possible. They follow a strict hierarchy, with the country using the first valid regency type from the following list.
