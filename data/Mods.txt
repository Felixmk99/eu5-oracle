A
mod
(short for
modification
) is an alteration of the game and the objective of
modding
. Modifications can range from small tweaks to total conversions.
Installation
[

Mods can be downloaded and installed from several sources:
Automatically using Steam's Client application from the
Steam Workshop
(Steam version only)
Manually from the
Europa Universalis V User Modifications sub-forum
Manually from
Nexus Mods
Mods from the Steam Workshop will be placed in
…/SteamLibrary/SteamApps/workshop/content/3450310
, named by their Workshop ID.
Locate Your Europa Universalis V Mod Directory

When running Europa Universalis V from Steam, the mod installation folder is:
OS
Path
Windows
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis V\mod\
Linux
[1]
steamapps/compatdata/3450310/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis V/mod/
If the mod folder doesn't exist, create it.
Never install mods into the game installation directory, as the mod will not be properly loaded.
Check in the mod description the Europa Universalis V version compatible with the version of the mod. If needed, rollback to an older
patch
, using “Steam Beta” tab in Steam or the “Game Settings” tab in Paradox Launcher.
Manual installation

The steps are usually the following (refer to specific mod instructions, if any):
Prepare
: Remove any existing installation of the mod (mod folder). This is very important, as the game loads all files present in mod folder, so old mod files that are no longer present or were renamed in a new version of the mod would conflict.
Place Mod Files Appropriately
: Extract the downloaded archive, so that the mod folder contains the mod folder with the
top folders
and the
.metadata
folder inside.
Enable the Mod in the main menu
: Start Europa Universalis V and select the mod in the "Dlcs and Mods View". Create a playset and add the mod to that playset.
Select the playset and press apply
: With the playset selected, click "Apply" to apply the mods. Europa Universalis V will then reload with the mod active!

this is the path which is used by steam when running eu5 from the steam library with proton. The location of the steamapps folder depends on the way how steam is installed. Usually
~/.steam/steam
is a symlink to the folder which contains steamapps and the default for the official .deb package is
~/.local/share/Steam
or
$XDG_DATA_HOME
. If another version of wine or a wine frontend is used, the location can be either in the virtual windows installation which wine is using, or it can map the Documents folder to one of the folders in the users home directory
