Parliament debating an issue
A
Country
can call its
Estates
into a session of Parliament, to solve any
Parliament Issue
they may have, while also giving the opportunities to create a
Casus Belli
, raise
Taxes
, increase
Army Levies
and
Naval Levies
, or change any of the current
Laws
. Any
Estate
may have a
Parliament Agenda
to resolve before they will pledge their support.
Parliament may take place in the
Capital
or another
Location
which receives some small benefits. If the
Location
becomes
Occupied
, the Parliament will fail.
Which estates can suggest parliament agendas depends on the parliament type. The Nobility estate can always suggest parliament agendas.
Parliament type

No Parliament
The only reason to summon others in front of the ruler can be to give orders, not to discuss policy.

Estate Parliament
Representatives of the Estates will gather in the parliament to discuss issues and find common ground in achieving these goals.

Autocratic Parliament
The issue with separated power is that many urgent actions from the government can easily be locked in bureaucratic chaos and dragging discussions. The power of the State must be focused on the hands of the sovereign to ensure the success of our country.

Parliament requests
[

]
Parliament requests are actions that a country can spend 50%
Parliament Support
on to get through. The support required can be reduced by 20% by the Full College reform and increased by certain Nobles estate privilege. The request takes effect even if the parliament later fails. (E.g., you have 55% Parliament Support, 'spend' 50% on a new law and then fail at the end of parliament with only 5% support: the new law stays in effect.)

Call parliament
[

edit source
]
The parliament can be called every 5 years in an attempt to get support to resolve a parliament issue. When the parliament is called, a location must be chosen as the parliament seat. Picking the capital will move societal values towards
Centralization while picking another location will move them towards
Decentralization and give the location the following for the duration of the parliament:
+5%
Max Control
+10%
Monthly Control
+0.01
Local Monthly Development
+1%
Local Monthly Prosperity
Once the parliament is called, the chosen parliament issue is debated for 180 days. Whether it passes or fails depends on the estate power used to support or oppose it. Each estate will support or oppose an issue, which adds its estate power to either side. The estate which proposed an issue will always support it. Accepting a parliament agenda costs varying amount of
stability and will shift societal values, enact a policy, affect opinion with another country, or reduce the taxes on the supporting estate for 5 years.
If the parliament has not been called within the last 120 months, for every months afterwards that it is not called all estates will lose
−1%
Satisfaction Equilibrium.

Stability. Each estate will propose up to two parliament issues each time.

Parliament agendas
[
edit
|
edit source
]
While a parliament issue is being debated, estates that didn't propose the issue and can vote in the parliament will offer a parliament agenda. Accepting a parliament agenda will cost resources and reduce the satisfaction of the other estates that can vote but will also add support to the parliament issue that scales with the proposing estate's power and satisfaction and the importance of the agenda. Once a parliament agenda is accepted the same estate will offer another one if it can but the support provided by the same estate will be reduced by
-25%
for each accepted agenda.
