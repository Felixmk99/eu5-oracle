Iceland is an island country located between Greenland to the west, British Isles to the south, Faroe Islands to the south-east and Scandinavia to the east. Iceland begins as a dominion of Norway and is in the personal union with Sweden (which is a senior partner), Norway, Scania and Greenland.
Iceland is good nation for colonization because it is closer to America then other countries, but because of limited resources and harsh climate playing this nation might be difficult.
