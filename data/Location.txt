A location
A location is the smallest unit of land. There are four types of locations:
Habitable
locations have
population
and can support ownership or be entered by armies. Each habitable location has a dominant
culture
and a dominant
religion
, which are the culture and religion followed by most pops. Each habitable location also has a raw good and may construct or upgrade an
R.G.O.
to extract it.
Impassable
locations do not have population and cannot support ownership or be entered by units. If all adjacent locations are owned by the same country, the impassable location will also take on the country's color on the map.
Corridor
locations do not have population and cannot support ownership but can be entered by armies and are always connected to two habitable locations. If both connected locations are owned by the same country, the corridor location will also take on the country's color on the map.
Seazone
locations do not have population and cannot support ownership but can be entered by navies. Seazones have Maritime Presence from adjacent countries.
Sea Current
locations function like seazones but also include a directional current, indicated by waves when the map is zoomed in and with arrows when the map is zoomed out. Navies traveling in the same direction as the current will move faster.
Map hierarchy
[
edit
|
edit source
]
The map is divided into 6 levels of subdivisions:
Continent
Sub-continent
Region
Area
Province
Location
Various actions will target different levels of the hierarchy.
Provinces share and distribute
Food between its locations, and levies are raised from an entire province at once. Several cabinet actions target a province. Each province has a province capital, which has a star in the middle of the rank icon. If the province capital is occupied during war, all remaining locations are automatically occupied by the invader over a short period of time. If a province spreads over two market areas, the market where the province capital is located will be used to buy and sell food. Each province has its own provincial food storage. Any food that is not consumed by the pops in a location is contributed to the provincial food storage. If monthly food is negative, stored food will be consumed. If there is a deficit, the province will buy food from its market, and if there is a surplus, the province will sell food on its market. Armies in the province can also consume stored food if they would otherwise suffer attrition.
Provinces refer to both a static set of locations – sometimes called a province definition – as well as the set of locations that a country owns within that set. Thus, two or more countries can each have a province within the same province definition.
Integration status
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Integration status represents how well a location is incorporated into the administrative apparatus of its owner. Every owned location falls into one of four different statuses. Conquered locations can be integrated via the Integrate Province cabinet action, and the integration speed depends on the number and culture of the population. Reaching Core status requires a 50% or more population of primary and accepted cultures.

Rank
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Each location has a
rank, which can be increased or decreased at any time. It affects what buildings can be constructed in the location, and increasing or decreasing the location rank will remove all incompatible buildings. The cost to increase a location's rank is impacted by market prices. Downgrading a location is instant and always costs 500
Gold and doesn't require goods.

Flatland
Flatland represents terrain that does not have any major topographic variation, so there are no impediments for Army movement or Building development.

A terrain with hills has variations in the topography, but the slopes are not as steep nor as high as those of mountains, so the penalties are also not as bad.

A seazone that has frozen
Seazones have one of the following topographies. Some seazones will freeze if the location experiences winter, which blocks ships from moving and allows armies to move on them. If an army is on a seazone when it thaws, half of it will be destroyed.

Lakes represent inland bodies of water without any contact with the open sea except through possible rivers, so no ships of relevance are able to sail in them.

Salt Pan
Salt Pans are barren expanses of extremely flat land formed by the evaporation of a lake or a pond.
Ocean Wasteland
This is ocean sea outside of the main currents, so it is not a convenient path for ships to take, as they could end up stranded in the middle of it.

Locations that are not adjacent to a seazone that cannot support ships, have a port or build ships and cannot be blockaded. Locations that are adjacent to a seazone can have a port and build ships and can be blockaded. In addition, locations that are adjacent to a seazone receive the following bonuses:

Sound tolls
[

]
A few locations have a Sound Toll, which add an additional Gold cost to trade routes from other countries that pass through the location and give 25% of that
Gold to the location's owner. Hovering over a Sound Toll will list all trade routes going through the location and the income from each. The following locations have Sound Toll:
Hormuz
Kōnstantinoúpolis
Roskilde
Countries can become exempt from Sound Tolls either through a Treaty or through events. Countries owning a Sound Toll location can remove exemptions but this will give the previously-exempt country the Sound Tolls Exemptions Broken casus belli.
Grand Canal of China

The Grand Canal of China is not visible on the world map and can only be seen as part of location modifiers. The canal flows through the following locations: Hangzhou, Wutong, Jiaxing, Songling, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Yancheng Baoying, Huaian, Huaiyin, Taoyuan Huaian, Suqian, Suicheng, Xuzhou, Peicheng, Guting, Jining, Wenshang, Dongping Yanzhou, Tongcheng, Liaocheng, Linqing, Guantao, Gexianzhuang, Gucheng Jingzhou, Dezhou, Sangyuan, Dongguang, Nanpi, Cangzhou, Qingzhou Hejian, Jinghai, Tianjin, Wuqing, Tongzhou, Beijing.
The Grand Canal of China gives every location it passes through the following bonuses:

After 1345 there is a 10% chance each month that the canal will be damaged, replacing its bonus with a
+10%
Proximity Cost penalty. Afterwards, as long as the Emperor of China owns at least one location that is part of the Grand Canal of China, every 4 years it has a 2.5% chance to be offered to pay a very large amount of scaled gold to repair the canal and restore its initial effects.

Depending on climate, locations may have

Winters begin around January for locations in the northern hemisphere and around June for locations in the southern hemisphere. Armies cannot move into locations with Mountains topography with Normal or Severe winter level. Winters always start as mild and increase in severity then reverse and decrease in severity

Control

Main article:
Control
Each location you own has a
Control
percentage, expressing how much the central government can tap into the ressources of the location. It has a wide range of effects, from directly impacting how much the local population can be taxed, to the amount of levies they will contribute when called. A lack of control in a location reduces the crown power gained from its population, while also decreases the manpower and sailors available locally and weakens the market attraction of your own markets, making them likelier to belong to foreign markets if they have low control.
Each percent of control has the following effects on locations:

Each percent of control below 50% has the inverse effect:

On top of these modifiers, the effective
Tax Base
of a location is calculated by multiplying the
Potential Tax Base
with the location's control.
