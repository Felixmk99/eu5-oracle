Tinto Talks #66 - 4th of June 2025
Thread starter
Pavía
Start date
Jun 4, 2025
Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will discuss the mechanics of
Islam
. In EUV, it is considered a Religious Group, as Christianity or Buddhism:
As usual, please consider all UI, 2D, and 3D art WIP.
​
As you see, three Religions compose the group: Sunnism, Shiism, and Ibadism:
They share similar features, and then inside them is where we make the religious differentiation:
The first mechanic is Schools, an old companion from EU4, but that has been reworked in EU5:
Muslim countries start with a School, which gives some modifiers:
As you can see, each School has a different view of the other. This is important because you can invite Scholars of Schools that are available for your branch of Islam, and also don’t have a negative opinion of your chosen School.
Because, yes, the old EU4 Scholars are also present in EU5, but they’re now inside a new category, the ‘Religious Figures’, which gives some more flexibility on how to use them:
Scholars are now characters that can travel through the Islamic world and be invited to work for you:
This unlocks the possibility to change the Main School of your country to that of the Scholar:
In total, we have this number of schools, with some schools being available to more than one religion:
10 Sunni:
Ḥanafī
Ḥanbalī
Mālikī
Shāfi'ī
Ẓāhirī
Ash'arī
Māturīdī
Aṯarī
Mu'tazilī
Wahhābī
11 Sufi - Both for Sunni and Shia, except 3:
Bektashi
Chishtī (only for Sunnism)
Ḵalwātī
Mevlevi
Naqshbandī (only for Sunnism)
Qādirī (only for Sunnism)
Ṣafavī
Shāḏilī
Suhrawardī
Īsāwī
Dīn-i Ilāhī
8 Shia:
Ismā'īlī
Ja'farī
Zaydī
Imāmīya
Nizārī
Musta'lī
Alevism
'Alawī
1 Ibadi:
Ibadi - only for Ibadi
It also has access to all the Sunni and Shia schools, but not the Sufi ones
The main currency for the religion is
Piety
, again a returning concept from EU4. Piety can go from a value of -100 to +100 (representing Mysticism or Legalism respectively), giving scaling benefits to the country depending on the direction.
Piety will be modified towards one extreme or the other mainly through events, although there are also some ways of adding a passive monthly tendency towards one direction, including privileges and cabinet actions. Another important aspect to mention regarding piety is the fact that to be able to invite a Scholar belonging to any of the Sufi schools, the country must already be leaning towards Mysticism.
There are a couple of actions in which the country can spend its piety to gain some benefits. A country can exchange piety for either stability or manpower, and both actions require being at 50 piety towards either direction, and move the value 40 towards the center.
There is also the option to perform a pilgrimage to one of the Holy Sites, as long as they are owned by the country, an ally, or someone with good relations. Performing a pilgrimage will give a small increase in piety, as well as sending the ruler on a holy journey.
Another important aspect to mention is the fact that Muslim countries have access to some unique laws and policies:
Implementing the Sharī'ah Law will unlock an extra law, the Sharī'ah Jurisprudence, with policies dependent on the country’s main school.
Finally, there are a couple of unique buildings available for Islamic countries:
And that’s all for today! Tomorrow is Thursday, which means that we will publish a new ‘Behind the Scenes’ video, and on Friday, we will take a look at the Ottomans and the Rise of the Turks situation!
And also remember, you can
wishlist Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

Hello, time has come
Do Safavid Order start as building based coutry in 1337? And what are the other flavour for Safavids?
Persia flavour already passed, so I think it is right time to ask for
Also, will some sufi orders also represented as building based countries?

Bringing back the instant manpower buttons was a bad call.  Overall a really disappointing dev diary when compared the the 4 Christian dev diaries.
Also is druze not considered part of the Islamic group?  I can see why it wouldn't but am curious to how it's defined.

why does going negative in piety gives also more satisfaction to the clergy ? Was there a typo in the code before the DD ?

Unless already done so, Dhimmi status should only apply to Abrahamic and Dharmic religions, as they historically did.
Over 2.3 million Tengri tribal pops in the Golden Horde for example are now Dhimmi estate because of it not being so.
Also, tribal pops in general shouldn't be considered for Dhimmi, because they are by nature not part of any group.

Are these two really different schools?
Sorry for ignorance, I'm really curious since it may seem like different 'localisations'.
