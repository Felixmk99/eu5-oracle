Venice (3280)
The Most Serene Republic of Venice is the most important and powerful merchant republic in the Mediterranean Sea. It controls important trade ports and islands which form the Stado do Mar, and many inland territories in the North of Italy, which form the Domini di Terraferma. Flush with prosperity from its extensive trade network, Venice is a beacon of wealth and culture, a lagoon-cradled jewel shining in the Adriatic Sea.
Nonetheless, this elegant city cannot lower its guard, as new threats arise around it. In the East, the once-great
Byzantine Empire
will not easily forget the Fourth Crusade, nor the Venetian involvement in it. In the West, the
Superb Republic of Genoa
and the
Crown of Aragon
continue to expand their influence, conquering more territory and dominating trade routes. Finally, the Most Serene Republic of Venice have become a palpable threat to the Domini di Terraferma.
What will the future hold for the Republic? Will it fall under the pressure of its enemies, or will it rise to the top and become the indisputable ruler of the Mare Nostrum?
Venice is a small Italian duchy with 17 locations spread across the Veneto and Friuli regions, Croatia, Northern Greece, Morea, and the Aegean Archipelago. At the start of the game, it has three subjects:
Candia
,
Ragusa
, and
Trieste
. Venice possesses the second-highest tax base among all nations in the Italian region, making it a strong contender for economic dominance in the area.
