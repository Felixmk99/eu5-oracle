Tables needing auto-generation
[
edit source
]
List of regiments
List of ships
List of casus belli and wargoals
Levy types
Disasters
Hints
- located in localization\english\hints_l_english.yml
Works of art
- path for this one is game\main_menu\setup\start\11_art.txt
Cultures
- the culture cells can be colored with the culture's map color similar to
https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Culture#List_of_cultures
Religious actions
- this one will be one of the most tricky because it's spread across multiple files in a folder that has all categories of actions
Formable countries
- optionally the sections can be subdivided into Historical, Plausible and Ahistorical to more easily show which are available depending on game rules
Succession laws
- different scripting from other law categories
Age of Traditions advances
- use the Advance template instead of file names (i.e. instead of [[File:Advance gunpowder advance.png]] use {{Advance|gunpowder advance}})
Age of Renaissance advances
- same as above
Age of Discovery advances
- same as above
Age of Reformation advances
- same as above
Age of Absolutism advances
- same as above
Age of Revolutions advances
- same as above
Diplomatic actions
- skip covert actions as those have their own section
Historical earthquakes
- scripted in events\earthquake_events.txt
Subject types
Cabinet actions
Religious aspects
Religious schools
Treaties
Languages
Parliament agendas
Holy sites
Starting countries
List of all modifications in game divided on category
Module:Defines/Comments
Draft

These tables are generated, but they are not finished. Suggestions for the formatting are very welcome
Traits
- use the Trait template instead of file names (i.e. instead of [[File:Trait literalist.png]] use {{Trait|literalist}})
Buildings#List_of_buildings
Religious laws
Military laws
Administrative laws
Socioeconomic laws
Estate laws
International organization laws
Parliament issues
Manually generated tables
[

These tables have been done manually, but it would be useful to autogenerate them, so that they can be updated quicker in the future and to reduce the risk of errors

go through the
Modifier_types#List_of_defined_modifier_types
and make sure that the effect of all modifier types which are used in the game, are described somewhere on the wiki and that the name of the modifier redirects to the section where it is described.
search the eu4 wiki for things which are still in eu5, but not listed on the eu5 wiki yet. And then add them here to the work needed page. Good places to start would be:
eu4:Category:Europa_Universalis_4
eu4:Template:Mechanics_navbox
eu4:Category:Game_concepts
eu4:Mechanics
eu4:Category:Realm
Adapt navboxes from other wikis and make sure that all content pages have one. Ideally the navbox or the specific tab in the navbox matches the category of the page
eu4:Template:Achievement_navbox
or a similar one from another paradox wiki
I would say
eu4:Template:Mechanics_navbox
is good, because it puts all the different types of mechanics in one navbox, but uses tabs so that it doesn't become too big(the first parameter can be used to change which tab is shown per default on a page) --

Autogenerate country data for use with
{{Country}}
and country list pages
I've made a mockup of a general country list (found
here
which would involve a separate page for each sub-continent (that could then be linked in the country navbox's headers). It further breaks down into regions where the charts are made on the page. Suggestions are appreciated, and if the process could be automated that would be excellent! I'm not any good creating autogenerators or controlling their output format.

add a page for

. Maybe in a way so that the list of songs from the DLCs can be transcluded into
Downloadable content
create
Settings
similar to
eu4:Settings
which describes all the ingame settings, the pdx_settings.json and the launch options. Some possible launch options are (most are untested and might not work or not actually launch options):
-dx12, -vulkan, -randomrenderer, -renderer= (options are dx12, vulkan, random, null (blank window) and maybe dx11, but dx11 crashes immediately), -debug_mode, -graphic_preset=very_low, -mapeditor (supposedly needs at least 64 GB RAM, better 128 GB), -nofilewatcher, -filewatcher, -nakama (writes an error into the logs), -steam, -language=l_english (other languages seem to work as well), -nographics (starts without a GUI, no idea how to interact with that), -gdpr-compliant, -antiloop (some kind of debugging thing to prevent infinite loops when restarting), -antiloop_multiplier=8, -antiloop_multiplier=2, --gui-validation=game, --gui-validation-settings=gui_validation_settings.json, -write_database_dependency_graph (writes graphs/database_graph.dot), -textureimporter (exits immediately?),-editormode (crash?), -test_mods, -nosounds (disables sounds), -markdown (eu5 does not open a window, but runs in the background), -force_text_save(non-ironman saves are written in plain text, even if -debug_mode is not active), -continuelastsave (load save game specified in continue_game.json), -loadsave=X (load save game from the file X (without file extension)), -rehost_savegame(Created savegame for rehost), -audio_debug_log_level, -playsets, -display_mode, -fullscreen, -windowed, -multi_sampling, -hardware_report, -rendersamples, -rendertest, -editormode, -run_console_action="X" (execute console command X, but gives error message instead. When using only
--run_console_action
you get a description). Maybe some of the other settings also work as command line options. Test if
--
also works instead of
-
. Find out if it is possible to change mods or playsets with command line options. The command line parameter
--command_line_help
outputs as list of some of the command line options:

Autogeneration
[
edit source
]
Many pages or sections on the Europa Universalis 5 Wiki contain
autogenerated
content. These are tables, sections, or other elements which are created from the game files through a script or tool and should not be edited by hand. Wiki users and contributors should instead suggest changes on the talk page where the content is located or the talk page of the
template
or
module
that generates the content.
Verification
[
edit source
]
Game information on the
Europa Universalis 5 Wiki
should be verifiable with references to game files or empirical tests.
The most basic form of verification is listing relevant game files in the
References
section of a page. For example:
== References ==
<references/>
----
* Religions are defined in {{path|common/religions|in_game}}
References
Religions are defined in
/Europa Universalis V/game/in_game/common/religions
More specific verification can use reference tags to highlight specific information and note its source. Some templates can assist with this, such as
{{Cite define}}
.
References to empirical tests should ideally refer to a forum post at
https://forum.paradoxplaza.com
or reproduction steps can be given as a reference, or if longer on the
Discussion
space for the page
Versioning
[
edit source
]
The wiki uses a versioning system to facilitate keeping pages up to date, and to warn readers of info that may be obsolete.
Every regular page on the wiki has a version number associated with it, indicated using the
{{version}}
template. This version number tells the readers and editors for what version the page as a whole was last verified. Any editor can update this if they've verified that all information on the page is up to date.
In addition, most pages include a version number for each section, indicated using the
{{SVersion}}
template. Like the overall version number, this tells the readers and editors for what version the section was last verified. If the version is the latest, this version number is hidden, but if it isn't then a warning appears at the top of the section. Any editor can update this if they've verified that all information in the section is up to date.
Once every section of a page that is versioned by section is up to date, then the page as a whole should be marked as up to date.
