The Welsh people descend from the ancient Celtic inhabitants of Britain; their domain stretched from the misty northern highlands to the rugged chalk cliffs of the southern coast. A land of fae and poets, of rain and sea, Wales was extraordinary in many ways. But Welsh dominion over their native lands could not be sustained.
First, the Anglo-Saxon warlords came, filling the power vacuum left by the fallen Roman Empire, and pushing the natives to the rocky peripheries of Britannia. Then came the Norman adventurers, who finally subjected them and dethroned their rightful rulers.
Today, our fortified administration lives at the behest of the English King, with authority over the Anglo-Norman marches of the southern valleys and the Welsh settlements of the northern mountains.
Wales
is a small country in Britain. It begins as a
dominion
of
England
, and has 10 vassals itself. It controls 8
rural locations
along the the coast of the Irish Sea. Its status as a subject and small
tax base
place Wales in a difficult situation at game start.
