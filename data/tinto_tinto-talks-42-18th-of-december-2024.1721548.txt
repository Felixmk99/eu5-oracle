Tinto Talks #42 - 18th of December 2024
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Dec 18, 2024
Welcome to another Tinto Talks, the happy Wednesday where we give you information about our upcoming super secret game with the codename Project Caesar.
This week we will be talking about the disaster system, which has been present in different forms in recent GSG games from Paradox.
Disasters
There are two major differences between a disaster and a situation. The first is that a disaster is almost always negative, and secondly a disaster is always for a specific country. While multiple situations can be active and involving a country at the same time, only a single disaster can happen at the same time.
There are also two categories of disasters. The specific historical narratives, and the generic ones that can happen to anyone under the right circumstances.
Disasters in Project Caesar are not just a modifier applied to the country, and some events triggering until you fulfill the winning conditions, but you also get unique actions you can do to affect the disaster.
Let's start looking at some common more generic disasters.
Court and Country
Resistance to the growing centralization in our country has culminated in a period of general crisis and conflict between Court and Country. Depending on how we handle this time of crisis we might come out of it a stronger country than before.
This disaster can happen to any country with strong Absolutism or Crown Power in the Age of Absolutism or Age of Revolution.
The Nobility has taken the biggest offence to this plan
As you can see above here the UI for this disaster shows your current crown power, and the power of your estates, while also showing the rebel closest to starting a civil war.  It also lists the current actions you have in the disaster. Here we cannot rein in the Nobility, as they are too strong already.
Two of the icons above have special tooltips that are useful for you as well.
You have to endure it for at least a decade..
In case you don’t know how to increase crown power..
Religious Turmoil
Despite the country's efforts to mediate between the different religious groups in our nation, conflicts have been erupting on a regular basis. The situation has worsened and without drastic measures, we will soon be engulfed in a religious civil war.
This disaster can occur during the Age of Reformation for any Catholic country or any country following any Protestant religion, if they have a low enough religious unity and a weak clergy estate.
To get out of this disaster there are multiple ways: get religious unity higher; get the power of the clergy much higher as a spiritualist; or go full humanist, while restoring stability.
While this disaster is happening, there will be a lot of conflict from religious minorities in the country.
If we look into some of the country specific ones, we have a few here, and we don’t want to spoil them all..
The Rise of Savonarola
An upstart preacher has started to spread his apocalyptic message, advocating for repentance and reform. His message is causing quite a stir among the population, and it's for sure a sign of changing times.
This is a disaster that is likely to happen to Florence in the last decades of the 15th century, if they are a Catholic republic.
To get out of this disaster you either have to become a Theocracy or Savonarola will have to die.
War of the Roses
Two junior branches of the House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York, both claim to be the rightful heir to the throne of England. Sporadic fights between their supporters have already broken out in a number of provinces around the country. Their heraldic symbols, a red rose and a white rose, have already become synonymous with the conflict now commonly known as the War of the Roses.
This is a specific disaster for England which can happen during the 15th century if the ruling dynasty is Plantagenet, and some specific historical events have happened. It will allow you to side with either York or Lancaster as it will build up to a civil war for the throne.
So, which historical events do you think would be best represented by a disaster? Post your suggestions here..
Now, you either get a Christmas present next Wednesday, or you get a lump of coal…

For example with "War of the Roses" disaster, your nation actually turns into red/white rose flagged nation and enemy one turns into white/red rose flagged nation? Or it's same like in EU4, where it's just rebels with their generic rebel flag? (Same for other similar-ish disasters?)

Civil wars in general could be a disaster. Horde instability could be a disaster. The collaps of China could be one. The mass death of natives after introduction of new illnesses could be a disaster. The instability of a multiethnic country (f.e. Austria Hungary) could be a disaster.

Hmm, so there are no natural disasters? No Lisbon earthquake and the like?
Disasters are strictly just "negative situations"?

Will disasters have lasting consequences after they are resolved?
Since C&C is currently used to boost the absolutism cap.

Very interesting...I wonder if the Hussite wars will be included as a desaster or at least Jan Hus and his reformation movement

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

This honestly sounds like a copy/paste from EU4.
Which is sad, since disasters in EU4 were/is generally uninspiring, tedious and posed no real threat after getting familiar with the game.

I think the Palaiologan Civil War should be a disaster likely to strike the Byzantines after the death of Emperor Andronikos, to simulate the unique instability of the empire at that time.
