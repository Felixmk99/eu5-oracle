Tinto Talks #84 - 15th of October 2025 - Onboarding Systems
Thread starter
Evife
Start date
Oct 15, 2025
Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about Europa Universalis V!
As you may have noticed, I’m not
@Johan
nor
@Pavía
; therefore, since this is my first official post in the forums, I will introduce myself. My name is Èric Vicent, and I’m UX Designer and UI Team Coordinator at Paradox Tinto. Before joining Paradox back in 2020, I was, just like most of you, a completely and utterly addicted Paradox fan for many years, having
Europa Universalis
as my core franchise, followed by
Crusader Kings
and
Hearts of Iron
. Some of you might recall me from some “
Behind the Scenes
” videos we have been posting on YouTube, and probably others may recognize me as an odd-looking armor in the
Skokloster Castle’s
Armory with Laith, where we did some cool interviews this past spring!
Now that we’ve got the boring part out of the way, let’s move on to the fun stuff:
EUV’s Onboarding Systems!
This week, we’re pulling back the curtain on one of the toughest design challenges we’ve faced so far:
teaching a Grand Strategy Game that’s, well… truly grand.
If you’ve ever tried to explain Europa Universalis to a friend, you probably know the look. That thousand-yard stare that says, “Wait, so you are a…  Country? And what exactly is an Estate again?”
Designing a learning experience for a game this deep is no small feat. But as game developers, we can’t just shrug and say “they’ll figure it out.”
Our goal is to invite players, new and veteran, into the grand strategy mindset
by not burying them under spreadsheets on day one.
So, in this development diary, we’ll talk about
Recommended Countries, Missions and Walkthroughs
that ease you into the core mechanics, along with
Hints, Automation
and other tools that will help you along the way. Also I’ll be explaining the
three design pillars
that guided us during this challenge:
Integration, Pace, and Reward.
Together, they form the backbone of a learning experience built not just to explain EUV, but to make the act of learning it part of the fun, by turning “
tutorials
” into something you’ll actually want to play.
Before We Dive Into the Onboarding Pillars:
​
Playstyles
Before building any system meant to teach, we had to answer a fundamental question:
"Whom are we really teaching?"
A game like this attracts a wide range of players, from veterans who can and want to calculate trade good market prices values in their sleep, to curious newcomers drawn by maps, flags, and a high level of ambition.
But no two players engage with the same mechanics in the same way, and in a game of this scale, trying to learn everything at once is unrealistic. Some players thrive on diplomacy and the art of negotiation; others find joy in mastering the flow of gold and goods; and a fair few simply prefer to solve geopolitical problems... with
cannons
.
To embrace all these playstyles, we’ve grouped them into three broad archetypes: Politics, Economy, and Expansion, each offering its own path through the grand tapestry of Europa Universalis V.
Politics Playstyle
: Focus on the internal politics, by dealing with the administration and estates of your country, and also establish deals and alliances with other countries to strengthen your international position.
Main Panels involved: Government & Society & Diplomacy.
Economy Playstyle
: Focus on the economic development of your country. Pursue national prosperity by exploiting the land, constructing buildings and importing goods in different markets.
Main Panels involved: Economy & Production.
Expansion Playstyle
: Focus on your army and navy. Declare war on your enemies and take control of neighboring lands by force, and also expand your navy to control the seas and expand your maritime presence.
Main Panels involved: Military & Geopolitics.
Our own Bartle’s Taxonomy on Playstyle Archetypes and main mechanics tied to them.
​
Recommended Countries
At the start of the game, players will find a curated list of
six recommended countries
, each hand-picked to offer a smooth and meaningful first experience. These nations are divided across the three playstyles:
two Political, two Economic, and two Expansion-oriented
, ensuring that every type of player has a natural starting point.
This classification doesn’t restrict what you can do with each country; you’re free to pursue any path you like. It simply means that, for your
first steps
,
the onboarding systems, that include walkthroughs, will emphasize the mechanics most relevant to that playstyle.
For instance, a politically-focused country will first introduce the inner workings of governance and diplomacy, while an economically-minded nation will help you grasp production chains and trade networks. As your campaign progresses, these same countries will gradually open the door to the other 2 playstyles, allowing you to explore warfare, economics, and politics in a natural progression, rather than all at once.
By choosing one of these six nations, new players can step confidently into the world of Caesar with a structured learning path built around the
Onboarding Pillars
we’ll discuss later, ensuring a gentle start to what will eventually become a truly grand experience.
These are our Recommended Countries for a fun learning experience.
​
Generic Walkthrough
Once you’ve chosen your starting country, you’ll enter what we call the
Generic Walkthrough
, the foundational layer of EUV’s onboarding experience. This step-based journey introduces the
core mechanics
every player needs to grasp before moving on to specialization: game systems like
Balance, Pops, Estates,
and other fundamental frameworks such as
Outliner, Map Modes, Hints, and Automations
, that shape the management of your nation.
Generic Walkthrough Start
Generic Walkthrough UI / Tooltips
​
The main goal of this walkthrough is to serve as your
first introduction to the world of EUV
, not only by explaining the main mechanics step by step, but by showing
why, where, and when
they matter. Each stage helps players locate relevant systems in the interface, understand their purpose, and recognize when they become important.
Generic Walkthrough / Open Hints Panel
​
Progression isn’t based on simply reading and acknowledging instructions;
it’s about taking action and experiencing the results.
Each task asks the player to interact with the game world and observe the consequences, because learning by doing is far more effective than passively following directions.
Generic Walkthrough UI / Automate Estates
​
On average, the Generic Walkthrough can take around
15 to 20 minutes to complete
, depending, of course, on
how deep your relationship with tooltips is
. Some players breeze through it; others take a short detour into a tooltip-reading odyssey. Now, here’s the best part:
the Generic Walkthrough flows seamlessly into your actual campaign
. You’re not playing a separate tutorial; you’re already ruling your country, making decisions that carry real weight. And this system isn’t restricted to the recommended nations: you can launch the Generic Walkthrough with
any country in the world at any time
. Of course, it is also
optional
; you can skip it at any given moment and go back when you want another attempt or a quick memory refresher.
Generic Walkthrough UI / Minting
​
Throughout the process, you’ll be supported by
contextual hints, tooltips, and small, achievable goals
that illustrate how your actions shape the course of history.
Once you’ve mastered these essentials, you’ll be ready to specialize and move on to one of the
three specific playstyle walkthroughs focused on Politics, Economy, or Expansion.
Politics Walkthrough UI / Diplomatic Actions
Economy Walkthrough UI / Markets
Expansion Walkthrough UI / War
​
Each walkthrough is tied to a set of
Learning Mission Trees
(I talk about this later on) that gradually unlock as you progress. Completing these missions transitions you from guided play into fully integrated gameplay, effectively merging learning with doing.
The Three Pillars of EUVs Onboarding
​
When we started designing these systems, we realized that teaching a Grand Strategy Game requires more than just good UI. It’s about psychology, pacing, and motivation.
We broke down the problem,
divide et impera
style, into three guiding principles:
Integration
: Tutorials should feel like part of the game, not a separate “mode.”
Pace
: Complexity should unfold gradually in order to avoid players feeling overwhelmed.
Reward
: Learning should be enjoyable, satisfying, and (dare we say?) fun.
Let’s unpack each one:
1. Integration
​
Let’s be honest:
nobody likes old-school tutorials
. You know the type that makes you go to an isolated game mode, feels like a mandatory chore to do before actually playing, and tells you: “Click here to build a Castle.” without explaining why and when you should really do that.
Players skip them because they feel artificial, disconnected from the actual play experience. In particular, we, as Grand Strategy players, tend to be… let’s call it independent-minded. We do not want to be told exactly what to do before understanding
why
we are doing it.
Instead of front-loading information, we built EUV’s onboarding around a simple truth of game design: Willingness to learn is directly tied to time investment. That idea became one of our guiding principles, and it aligns nicely with the philosophy George Fan described in his
GDC talk “How I Got My Mom to Play Plants vs. Zombies.”
In EUV,
Integration
means embedding learning directly into the fabric of the game itself. Rather than just trusting an isolated tutorial as a separate mode, we’ve created a network of in-game tools that naturally support players as they play, so learning happens seamlessly, in context, and at their own pace. These tools take many forms: Tooltips, Hints, Alerts, and even custom-tailored hints for Situations, certain game mechanics, and each of the six recommended countries we offer at game start.
Tooltip Alert with an associated Dynamic Hint
​
Alerts: Blue for tips, Green=Things you can do; Yellow: Things should attend, Orange: Urgent things to attend; Red: Top tier urgency and Wars; Purple & Black for Situations and Disasters
​
Hints in particular are always accessible, but also appear when it’s relevant in the
Agenda
, helping players connect cause and effect as they go. And for those who prefer a more structured approach, everything is also gathered in central
learning hubs
such as the
Europedia and the Hints Panel,
accessible at any time.
Agenda Window + Hints Panel with a Recommended Country Hint
​
The result is an onboarding experience that feels less like following instructions and more like
discovering how to play one decision, one insight, one tooltip at a time
.
2. Pace
​
Here’s another truth about Grand Strategy games:
they can be overwhelming
. At the start of a typical campaign, you’re greeted by a wall of spreadsheets, buttons, tabs, and flashing alerts, all demanding attention at once. For new players, that’s not “depth”, it’s a fast track to
panic mode
.
To tackle this, we looked toward a timeless principle of good design:
The Inverted Pyramid of Decision-Making
, which in a complex game such as this, resonates well. A game should begin with just a few meaningful choices, and gradually expand as the player’s understanding grows. By the time you’re managing multiple systems, you already know what each of them means and why it matters.
That principle works naturally in turn-based games, where time conveniently stops while you think. But Grand Strategy titles live and breathe in
real time and not just as a turn-based
, which makes pacing far trickier. So we asked ourselves: how do we recreate that gentle learning curve?
Our answer is
Adaptive Automation
. In EUV, most major systems can be
automated
. It’s optional, flexible, and entirely under the player’s control. Early on, you might automate several of these systems to focus on the fundamentals or simply the playstyle tied to the recommended country of your choice: learning what matters without juggling everything at once. As your mastery grows, you can start switching off automation feature by feature, taking full control at your own pace.
This not only creates a smoother onboarding for newcomers but also gives veterans powerful tools to shape their experience. A long campaign naturally goes through phases; perhaps during wartime, you let your economy run itself, and in peacetime, you turn your attention inward, managing estates and diplomacy in detail.
Adaptive Automation isn’t just for beginners; it’s a quality-of-life system for everyone
.
Generic Walkthrough / Automation Step + Automation Panel
​
Each
Playstyle Walkthrough
gently guides players toward which systems they might want to automate first, depending on their chosen
Playstyle
and
Recommended Country
. You can toggle automation on or off at any time, using it to pace your learning — or simply to take a breather from managing every moving part of an empire.
In the end,
Pace
in EUV means freedom: the freedom to decide how much you want to handle, when you want to handle it, and how you want to grow into the full complexity of the game. It’s learning through empowerment, not restriction.
3. Reward
​
Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room:
Tutorials are rarely fun.
They’re often skipped or rushed through just to “
get to the real game
.” But in a Grand Strategy game like EUV, the process of figuring things out can be half the fun
if players have the right tools and structure around them.
Beyond the integration and pacing systems we’ve already discussed, we wanted to add another layer that taps directly into the player’s sense of motivation and accomplishment. Research into learning and cognition consistently shows that
deep understanding happens when one actively performs the task, not when they just follow instructions
. Players learn best when they take meaningful actions, see the results, and connect cause and effect on their own.
That’s where
Learning Mission Trees
come in. Each Mission Tree offers a series of
short-term, focused objectives
, not abstract “lessons”, but
real gameplay challenges that matter to your nation
. You might be asked to establish a trade route, integrate your territory, balance your estates, or wage a limited war under specific conditions. Completing these tasks feels satisfying because they represent genuine progress inside a campaign.
Mission Panel / Mission Focus
​
Missions
in EUV act as a bridge between theory and experience:
they encourage players to make decisions that are both educational and impactful
. Every completed goal reinforces a mechanic in context, so players aren’t simply memorizing features; they’re mastering them through meaningful play.
Mission Tree / Develop a Capital Economy
​
And as you complete missions of an specific Playstyle, the game can gradually reduce automation on relevant systems, letting you take control naturally and
allowing you to unlock the rest of the Walkthroughs
. You’re not being lectured or led by the hand; instead, the game gives you the chance to
earn your understanding step by step
.
Mission Panel / Current Tasks
Missions in the Outliner: Here you can Unlock and Replay specific Walkthroughs.
​
To wrap up
Designing an onboarding system for a Grand Strategy game as deep as Europa Universalis V has been one of our toughest and most rewarding challenges we’ve tackled at Tinto. Our goal wasn’t just to make the game easier to learn, but to make
learning it part of the experience itself
.
From
Recommended Countries and Adaptive Walkthroughs to Hints, Automation, and Learning Mission Trees
, everything is designed to guide without restricting. You can skip steps, turn off missions, or jump straight into free play whenever you like. You’re the ruler; we just hand you the tools. We’ll continue refining the systems as we gather feedback from internal testing and, eventually, from you.
That’s all for today’s Tinto Talks! Next week, our CM, Ryan, will dive into the
Modding Systems
of the game!
And also remember, you can
Pre-Purchase Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

Would it not be better to have more "regional" alternative starts like in CK3's starting polities/rulers (not taking into account start dates)? That way more countries can be recommended and more regions shown to a new audience, without compromising the core idea of political, economic and expansion orientation of the nations recommended.
(Apologies for the old screenshot, I deleted CK3)

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

That’s a great point, the original concept for Recommended Countries actually included around 36 nations worldwide, across four different playstyles. But that scope turned out to be too ambitious to keep a strong balance between content and onboarding flow.
That said, the Walkthrough systems and the Learning Missions can be played with any country, so you’re never locked out of the experience, you can learn the game with whichever country you prefer, but we felt these six nations best captured the spirit and teaching goals of each playstyle while keeping the first-time experience focused and cohesive

It was discussed originally, and we do have advisors in EUV but instead of narrated they take the form of actual courtiers, who share knwoledgeable tips through the Hints Panel as you play. Our goal is to potentially expand this system so that advice feels more alive and connected to what’s actually happening in your campaign.

Great DD! And here I was wondering what an onboarding system was. A few things I notice:
1. This is a bit like Victoria 3 tutorials, but I think it's better in most regards.
2. I really like the UI now. It looks distinctive and not thrown together for the first time.
3. Great to see missions, and I like the design philosophy here with no arbitrary rewards. I hope even generic missions adapt to the conditions of our campaign though, in EUIV the missions really did not take into account any possibility of tall play.
4. I love automation, it looks really cool and useful. How far-reaching is it? Any more types to add? Military automation?
5. I like the little banners under the top bar I think. Feels lindy. Hope the ledger and map modes are also as satisfying.
6. Top left still looks a bit weird. I think you should DEFINITELY ditch the ruler face and keep the flag. It's that simple. Nobody asked for the ruler's face on the top left.
7. I agree with people that regional recommended nations would be better, perhaps at least 4-5 sets, like in Asia or MENA? Also politics-expansion-economy does feel a bit awkward as a phrasing. IDK what would be better though.
8. Modding next week has got me hyper excited.

"you can launch the Generic Walkthrough with
any country in the world at any time"
.
This is such a great feature, I may be in the minority here but I do struggle with the EU games in particular idk why. Having this though is so amazing and will go such a long way for enjoyment, thank you! The entire onboarding system is incredible as a whole, I really wish Vic 3, CK3 and Hoi 4 had this type of onboarding as well but let's be honest.... In a couple weeks we won't care about those games (;
Edit: I also want to say how lovely the UI has become over all this time, well done to the whole team November 4th can't come soon enough

EUIV has a war alert in the top too, I think many people just disable it once and never enable it again. Is the bottom one entirely out?
Also, is there an in-game lexicon/encyclopedia?
