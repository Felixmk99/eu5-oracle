War between countries
When declaring war, the war declaration window will show a comparison between the armies and navies of each country. The country that declares war and the country that was declared war upon will be called the War Leaders. Allies may join each side depending on their opinion of both sides and their distance from the enemy, but only the War Leaders can receive and accept peace proposals. Allies that are already at war have a
-100
acceptance and are unlikely to join the war. A country cannot declare war on a country that's on the same side in a war.
If multiple countries are on the same side in a war, each country will have a War Participation percentage, which is how much they contributed to the war. It has no effect during civil wars, but during country wars, countries will react positively or negatively to treaties that favor or do not favor them depending on how much the country contributed.
Every country has an Army Size and a Navy Size number displayed in its tooltip. Army Size is calculated based on existing regiments, manpower, and army levies that can be raised. Navy Size is calculated based on existing ships, sailors and naval levies that can be raised.
After a peace treaty, a truce is formed between the war leaders. Truces block certain diplomatic actions and give penalties if war is declared again during that period.
Types of wars
[

|
edit source
]
There are two possible types of wars: country wars and civil wars.
Civil wars
are wars that start when a rebellion reaches 100% progress. When a location either falls within the zone of control of an enemy fortification or is successfully sieged, it becomes owned by the enemy. Civil wars do not use casus belli, treaties or warscore and can only end in the complete surrender and annexation of either side.
Country wars
are wars started when a country declares war on another country. When a location either falls within the zone of control of an enemy fortification or is successfully sieged, it becomes occupied and usually has to become so before it can be added to a peace treaty. Country wars use casus belli, treaties and warscore.
Casus belli
[

edit source
]
Literally meaning
cause for war
, the casus belli is the justification a country uses for starting a war. Depending on the Casus Belli used, the type of war and the wargoal will be different. Most casus belli have to be created before they can be used, which costs 20 Spy Network. Most casus belli expire if they are not used within 4 years. Casus belli can also be created through
international organization
actions,
situations
, and other random events. War can be declared without a casus belli, but this incurs an additional cost. Each casus belli has a wargoal, which is the objective established for the war. Achieving the wargoal will grant ticking warscore over time, while not achieving it reduces warscore. When the wargoal changes status, its warscore impact is cleared.

The peace treaty interface
A country can leave a war by proposing peace to the opposing war leader and the opposing war leader accepting the proposal. The country that proposes peace can choose to either enforce demands, which allows picking peace treaties that give the country a benefit, or offer tribute, which allows picking peace treaties that give the opponent a benefit. Demands and offers can target any country on the opposing side of the war. Demands will increase the antagonism of the country sending the proposition, while offers will increase the antagonism of the opposing war leader. Demands also requires the warscore to be at least 10 towards the country making the demand. A war will end when the war leaders sign a treaty, but after the war had dragged for a year countries that are not the war leader can propose peace with the enemy war leader for themselves.
Each treaty has a peace cost, which scales with the scope of the treaty. A country will only accept a peace proposal if its acceptance is higher than the peace cost. Acceptance depends on the difference in warscore, their war exhaustion, and how long the war has dragged out. In case of offering tribute, acceptance is massively decreased if the country receiving the offer would gain too much antagonism for it.
Gold can also be added to a demand or offer, which add or deduct from the peace cost. The peace cost is reduced by −10% if both countries have the same primary religion or primary culture.
Vassalizing an enemy in a peace deal will only be available when the country making demands has equal or higher
country rank
as the target country. In cases where the country making demands has a lower country rank, the Vassalize treaty will be hidden from the peace treaty menu.
If a treaty gives a war ally more land than they'd expect from their war contribution and the peace treaty is accepted, the country that proposed the treaty will gain Favors from the said war ally.

Warscore
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Warscore is the value that indicates how well a country is performing in a war. A country can increase their warscore by winning battles, managing to siege enemy locations, achieving the wargoal, and establishing blockades. Warscore obtained from battles is capped to 50%. A warscore of at least 10 is required to make demands during a peace treaty.
Every location has a warscore value, which determines how much warscore it will give if occupied. Each location gives the following amount of warscore
2 always
1 has a port
1 is a province capital
5 is a country capital
0.25 per fort level
0.05 per development
Up to 4 depending on population
Up to 10 depending on buildings
War exhaustion
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Every country has a war exhaustion, which represents how much is has been ravaged by war. If it is high enough, the country will be forced to sign a peace treaty. Each point of war exhaustion brings the following penalties:
−2%
Army morale
−2%
Navy morale
−1%
Production efficiency
−1%
Trade efficiency
−0.03%
Population growth
War exhaustion decreases by
−0.1
each month while the country is at peace.

+40

+50

+50

Blockade
[
edit
|
edit source
]
A blockade is when a hostile
navy
is present in the sea zone adjacent to a port. How large the navy has to be depends on each ship's Blockade Capacity and the
population
, development, exports, and imports of the port locations.
The most important effects of blockade:
• Reduce
Food
Production
• Reduce
Maritime Presence
• Reduce
Development
• Reduce
Control
• Reduce
Prosperity
Privateering
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Privateers are pirates which are paid by a country to stay in an area and will only target countries that are at war with it. Hiring privateers requires either certain
Piracy Law policies or the
Letters of Marque generic advance but can also be unlocked through some country-specific advances or reforms. Hiring privateers costs 250
Sailors, but this can be reduced by a few advances. All countries adjacent to the selected area will lose 25
Opinion with the country that hired the privateers.
