The population tab
Population is divided into
pops
based on social class,
culture
,
religion
and location. Each pop has a literacy level, a satisfaction level, and pop needs that must be met.
Every pop has a
culture
,
religion
, social class, and location. If the country's primary culture or religion is different from a pop's culture or religion, the population will slowly change their culture and religion to the country's primary ones. This process is called Assimilation and depends on the average literacy of Clerics and is reduced by 1% for each 1% Control below 100% in the location.
Hovering over the population number on the top information bar will automatically change the map mode to population view.
Demographics

The population growth of the pops in a location is connected to how many are born in a month compared to how many died. It is increased by prosperity, capacity, the price of food in the location and the amount of food stored in the province. It is decreased by lack of food, diseases, sieges, or other calamities.
Every location has a Population Capacity, which is the amount of population it can support. It is affected primarily by the location's rank, vegetation, climate, development, and whether the location is coastal or a country capital. The less population a location has compared to its Population Capacity, the faster population will grow, especially when a location has less than 10% population compared to its Population Capacity. If population becomes higher than Population Capacity, it will not be able to grow more and will cause population to migrate away.
Each location has a Migration Attraction. If Migration Attraction is negative, pops will slowly migrate to the location within the same market that has the highest Migration Attraction. Pops of the Laborers, Soldiers, Peasants, Tribesmen, and Slaves social classes require specific
estate privileges
in order to migrate.
Population Growth

Population Growth determines the rate at which new pops are born in a location each year. Each month,

{\displaystyle {\frac {(pops)\times (pop\ growth)}{12}}}
new pops will be born in each location. For example, a location with
+1%
Population Growth and 10,000 population will gain 9 new pops per month (the number appears to always be rounded up). Note that pop loss due to "starvation" is really just negative population growth, and as such can occur even if the province has plenty of food (though due to the large malus, real starvation is still the most common reason).
Pops are born as peasants or tribesmen, based on the pops already in the location. If both peasants and tribesmen are present, the newly born pops will be assigned social classes based on the ratio between them (notably, while other social classes are counted for total population growth, they are not counted in this ratio). As a result, highly urbanized locations (i.e. those with few peasants remaining due to promotion) which still have tribesmen present may see an unexpected increase in tribesmen due to this calculation.

Literacy

Literacy is a measure of how well pops can read and write and ranges from 0% to 100%. Literacy provides bonuses based on the pop's social class and is also used to calculate the country's Average Literacy. Each 1% of country Average Literacy gives a

Monthly Progress to Innovative
+1%

+0.1%
Skill of New Artists bonus.
Additionally, average literacy of different social classes' on each location gives local bonuses to that location. For example, Monthly Promotion Speed in each location is increased for each 1% Average Literacy of
Peasants.
Pop satisfaction
[

]
Pop satisfaction is a measure of how happy pops are with their situation in life and is influenced by the following factors:
The satisfaction of their estate
The unrest in their location
The tolerance of their religion
The culture status of their culture
Pop needs
Market price of pop needs
Pop satisfaction ranges from 0% to 100% and every point of pop satisfaction below 100% brings the following effects:
-0.0025%
Monthly prosperity (starts at
0%
)
-0.1%
Max control (starts at
0%
)
-0.1%
Institution growth (starts at
+10%
)
Pops join rebels when below 20% satisfaction. This can be reduced by stability and other factors but can never go below 5%.
Pops leave rebels when above 35% satisfaction. This can be increased by stability and other factors but can never go below 10%.
Social class
[1]
[

edit source
]
Each pop in every location belongs to a social class. Unemployed Tribesmen and Slaves will slowly promote to Peasants and if there is available employment at higher social classes Pleasant will upgrade to these. If the population of the higher classes is higher than the available employment then pops will demote to Peasants. The speed at which pops promote and demote can be affected by a variety of factors.
