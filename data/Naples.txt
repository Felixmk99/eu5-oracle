Napule (3016)
The Kingdom of Naples stands at the crossroads of its own troubled history. Born from the ambitions of powerful dynasties seeking dominion over the lands of southern Italy, Naples rises as a bastion of resilience and cultural fusion that extends from ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans, to the more recent dynasties of the Hauteville, di Hohenstaufen, and Anjou, each leaving an indelible mark on Neapolitan identity.
In the year 1337, the Kingdom finds itself under the rule of a visionary leader, King Robert the Wise Anjou. A wise and just ruler known for his sagacity and keen judgment, he has navigated the intricate web of political alliances with finesse. His rule has brought a period of relative peace and a welcome respite from the turbulence of the past.
What will become of Naples when his steady hand falters? What will his successor do to stave off all those who covet the Neapolitan lands? The tale of Naples's future is as yet unwritten...
Naples
is a Neapolitan culture nation that begins as one of the
Catholic
kingdoms of Europe in 1337.
