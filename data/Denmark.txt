Long a powerful player on the world stage, the Kingdom of Denmark now finds itself in quite a precarious situation. During the previous rule of King Christoffer 2. Estridsen, large portions of the country were mortgaged to prominent members of the Danish and German
Nobility
, the
Duchy of Schleswig
was forcibly separated from the crown lands, and even the territory of
Scania
had to be sold to the
Kingdom of Sweden
. This shameful state of affairs worsened when King Christoffer 2. Estridsen was dethroned by Count Gerhard III. von Schauenburg after installing his own nephew Duke Valdemar 5. Estridsen on the throne, only to ultimately be brought back again as a puppet king. Since King Christoffer 2.'s death, Count Gerhard III. has been the de facto ruler of Denmark.
It will not be easy to overcome this situation, but Danish are resilient and resolute, and Valdemar Estridsen, son of King Christoffer 2. is already crafting a plan to recover the authority of the Kingdom. Whether it will be successful or not remains to be seen.
Denmark
is a country in southern Scandinavia, holding land in
Scania
and
Estonia
. In 1337, Denmark starts in a
Noble's Regency
under the rule of
Count Gerhard III von Schauenburg
.

The player can hold off on repaying the many loans that Denmark starts with due to the Tuscan Banking Crisis event, which can be exploited in order to cancel any debts taken up by Italian banks in exchange for a hit to
Diplomatic Reputation. The player should get an event for
A Royal Wedding
starting around 1338, which will push Valdemar Estridsen towards becoming king. After a few years Count Gerhard III will be assassinated, pushing Valdemar Estridsen to the throne and instantly annexing
Schleswig
. Denmark holds two overseas territories which can be either sold by event or kept. Firstly,
Sweden
may ask to buy the two Danish possessions in Scania for their vassal. Secondly, Estonia will revolt after the St. George's Night Uprising event. The player can choose whether to continue to fight and lose cores on the province, or to sell it to
Livonia
.
