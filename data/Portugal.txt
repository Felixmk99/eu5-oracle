The Kingdom of Portugal won its independence after a long and hard-fought struggle against both the Muslim and Christian rulers of the Iberia Region. After enacting the important social, economic, and cultural reforms promoted by King Dinis, his son and successor, King Alfonso IV the Brave de Borgonha may now face different challenges and opportunities while ruling over the Portuguese people.
To the west and south lies the wide North Atlantic Ocean and the promise of new trade routes with foreign lands, while to the east the powerful
Crown of Castile
, with strong dynastic connections to Portugal, could one day lead to a united Iberia under Portuguese leadership.
Whatever the future holds, Portugal will need to secure its position one way or another to ensure its future as an independent country.
Portugal
is a country in western Iberia, located West of Castile.
