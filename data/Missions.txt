The Humiliate a Rival mission
Missions are packages of individual tasks which are available to a country and serve as a guidance for the country. Each country can have only one active mission at a time. The mission can be changed at any point but this will reset all progress.
Missions are only available if they are enabled in
game rules
. Depending on game rules, missions or their tasks may or may not provide rewards.
If a mission is aborted it cannot be selected again for 5 years. Missions are automatically aborted if the country no longer meets the requirements to have the mission.
