The Ethiopian Empire is an ancient land rich with history and traditions. Nestled in the Horn of Africa, it boasts lush highlands, windswept plateaus, and the incomparable Great Rift Valley. Newcomers are captivated by its beauty, entranced by the golden sunsets against the Simien Mountains.
Ethiopia's enchanting tapestry weaves together diverse ethnic groups like the Amhara, Afar, and Tigre. United by trials, Ethiopa remains resilient like an ancient baobab tree, enduring through time.
Inspired by these ancient origins, Ethiopia cherishes legendary unions like that of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. The legacy of their son Menelik, the first member of the Solomon dynasty, echoes through the ages, connecting people of this land to the ancient Israelites.
Through the years, Ethiopia's epic tale unfolds, shaped by destiny and the unwavering spirit of its people. Triumphs and tribulations weave a rich tapestry of life's ebb and flow.
However, this nation is a realm encircled by adversaries who eagerly await any opportunity to strike. Managing not only to survive, but thrive, will be a challenge.
Ethiopia is an empire situated in the Horn of Africa that begins the game as the strongest of the Miaphysite countries, but it is precariously close to several powerful adversaries, most notably the
Mamlūk Sultanate of Egypt and
Yemen
. At the start of the game, Ethiopia has five vassals:
Ifat
,
Hadiya
,
Dawaro
,
Ennarea
, and
Bale
.

The Ark of the Covenant
We are the only nation to house the sacred Ark of the Covenant after it was taken in secret by Menelik I with divine assistance thousands of years ago. It is hidden away from public view, lest they would attempt to steal our sacred, national treasure. Replicas of the Ark are placed in every single one of our churches as a reminder that our rule is blessed by God.
