The Crown of Castile was formed through the union of its two constituent parts, the Kingdom of Castile and the Kingomd of León, when they were reunited after both titles were inherited by King Fernando III the Saint de Borgoña in 1230. A century later, King Alfonso XI the Avenger de Borgoña rules without much opposition, having overcome a troubled start to his reign following the end of a long regency under his grandmother, Maria de Borgoña.
After reining in the nobility of the realm, led by his relative Juan Manuel de Villena, and having stabilized the governance of the country, King Alfonso XI is now turning his attention to the southern border. The
Nasrid Emirate of Granada
has menaced our country since the emirate became independent a century ago, backed by the powerful
Marinid Sultanate of Morocco
, which has a foothold on Iberia through a petty kingdom centered on Al-Ǧazīraḧ al-Khaḍrā and Ḥiṣn al-Rundaḧ, and held by Crown Prince Abd al-Wahid Abu Malik Marinid, son and heir of Sultan Abu al-Hasan 'Ali ibn Uthman Marinid.
However, these are not the only troubles for King Alfonso XI, as his relationship with his beloved mistress, Leonor de Guzmán, and his children by her have eroded the relationship with the king's actual wife, Consort Maria de Borgonha, daughter of King Alfonso IV the Brave de Borgonha. With the latter living apart from the King, this rift in the royal family now leaves the looming question of just who will succeed him when he passes.
Will King Alfonso XI and his successors be able to deal with these threats to the Crown of Castile, both at home and abroad?
The Crown of Castile occupies the center of the Iberian peninsula. It’s surrounded by
Aragon
,
Granada
,
Navarre
, and
Portugal
at the start of the game. If Castile can survive the Black Death and the madness of its second monarch they have the potential to to unite the peninsula under
Spain
for the first time since the Visigothic Kingdom at the beginning of the Middle Ages. Once the peninsula is unified Castile can sail beyond the Pillars of Hercules.
