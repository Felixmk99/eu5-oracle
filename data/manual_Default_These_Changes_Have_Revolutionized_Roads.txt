[00:00:00 - 00:01:01] Yet more patches and changes as Europa Universalis 5 continues to grow. All based on your valued feedback from our socials and forums. It can only mean one thing. It's time to talk some development. Hello and welcome back to the currently named This Week in Development. Our show where we give you the latest and greatest news from Paradox Tinto and I am your host Alex/midgeman. And when I say latest, we have had an absolutely explosive week of releases. We've had a major patch move to the live

[00:00:31 - 00:01:29] environment, a lost hot fix that mysteriously appeared, a new Tinto talk, and a massive new open beta that changes your empire's infrastructure that you can opt into right now. If you've been overwhelmed by the sheer number of versions flying around, 1.08, 1.09, 1.0, don't worry, I've got you covered. I've gone through the forums and broken it all down so you don't have to. So, grab a drink, settle in, and let's break down exactly what happened this week. But before we go anywhere else, I wanted to

[00:01:00 - 00:01:55] highlight this number and this number alone. Do you want to know what this is? This is the number of bug fixes I can count since we've released. And that's just from my personal ability to count, which again can't trust sometimes. And the reason I wanted to highlight this is I know some people have been concerned about how much we've been changing the game and how much we've been focused on balance changes when really we have actually been focusing quite hard on bug fixes and they are very very important

[00:01:28 - 00:02:23] to us. If you have a bug that you haven't reported that you want to please use our bug report link. We have a special forum dedicated to it that the devs go through quite often. As European Universalis is so expensive, there's bound to be bugs. But we are dedicated, and I mean dedicated, to fixing them. Now, let's talk about the live version of the game, shall we? Patch 1.0.8 officially went out of beta into the live realms. We covered this in detail in our last episode, but for those of

[00:01:55 - 00:02:53] you who strictly play on the main branch of the game, this one was a big change. This is the update that brought in the economic base changes as well as the shift away from the centralization meta. To recap, the biggest shift was centralization is no longer a click to win button. If you play a wide empire with many vassels, decentralization is now a legitimate powerful strategy, offering up to plus 30 subject loyalty and better estate satisfaction recovery. Also, for the builders out there, the

[00:02:24 - 00:03:21] population requirements for free building levels dropped from 200k to 20k. That means if you're playing a tall nation, your cities can now go a whole lot deeper and further. And if for some reason you haven't updated yet on Steam, go do so. Trust me, your economy will thank you. Next up is where things got a little chaotic, shall we say. Shortly after 1.0.8 went live, the community started whispering about a lost hot fix, and lo and behold, on Thursday, it dropped. Joking aside, this was a purely

[00:02:53 - 00:03:47] technical mission. The Tinto developers identified some critical stability issues that were plaguing specific play styles, so we squashed them. Here's what we fixed. First, a nasty crash to desktop related to levy constructions. If you were trying to raise your peasant armies and the game just suddenly vanished, don't worry, that's fixed now. Second, a similar crash related to military constructions in general was also fixed. Third, we fixed a very specific bug where hot joining a multiplayer game as a non-settled

[00:03:20 - 00:04:21] country could instantly trigger a game over screen. That's certainly one way to shorten the session. And then finally, a crash related to unit movements occurring when a unit view wasn't open was also fixed. It's a small update on paper, but if you are suffering from these crashes, 1.0.9 is a lifesaver. Now, let's talk about the main event. Yes, we had another Tinto Talk. On Wednesday, Johan gave us Tinto Talk 90. Wow, we're up to 90 already. And while it covered a lot of ground, there is one

[00:03:50 - 00:04:51] feature that stole the show. Proximity and roads. Currently, terrain features, think dense jungles or heavy forests, massively impact your proximity calculation. This makes governing a jungle nation a nightmare. But Yan revealed a change coming to the mechanics. Roads will now ignore vegetation impact in regards to proximity. Let me repeat that. Roads now ignore vegetation. This means that building a road isn't just a small speed boost anymore. It is the only way to effectively civilize and control rough

[00:04:21 - 00:05:13] terrain. It makes infrastructure projects essential for the expansion into Wild Frontiers. We also got a peek at some UI quality of life changes. Soon you'll be able to see production efficiency of location before you construct a building there. No more mental math or guessing. The UI will tell you if that lumber mill is really worth the timber. Johan also shared some player statistics that I found concerning. The most buildings that are built are unsurprisingly market villages, irrigation systems, and

[00:04:47 - 00:05:38] marketplaces. But the most picked estate privilege is the one that gives the weapons to the peasants. I see you like living dangerously. I'm sure arming your population won't have any negative effects or consequences once the age of revolutions comes around now, will it? All right, time to put your testing helmets on if you want to, as we're moving on to open beta 1.0.10. This is available on the beta branch currently and went live at the end of last week. It's a hefty open beta and it

[00:05:13 - 00:06:18] has been based very heavily on your feedback from 1.0.8. Like I said, the team is working fast. First up is a victory for equality, and for any nation playing with a badass queen. The ruler must be a commander law has been updated. It now officially allows female rulers to lead armies. No longer will your warrior queen be forced to sit at home while her generals have all the fun. The onseas antipiriracy has received a massive buff again. The notes say the strength of Navy's antipiriracy efforts have been increased by a large

[00:05:46 - 00:06:46] amount. If you've been annoyed by privateeers strangling your trade, it's time to send out a fleet and clean up the ocean. And tying back to the Tinto talks, roads in this beta are significantly more powerful. Paved roads used to give about 15% market access. They now give 20%, later roads jump from 25% to a whopping 40% market access. Combined with the changes to how market access is being calculated, it now takes the best connection, river or road, rather than a weird average. Building a

[00:06:16 - 00:07:14] highway network is now a very powerful economic tool you have. But it's not all buffs. I'm sad to say the aristocracy took a major hit. The nobles recruitment center building, well, it got decimated. It was giving 250 nobles, but now gives the accurate 25. That's a 90% nerf. Clearly, the devs felt the nobility was getting a little too powerful. Maybe everyone wants a revolution right now, proving that the Tinto team just doesn't sleep. Just the other day, we got a hot fix for the open beta. Two major things

[00:06:45 - 00:07:41] to note here. Number one, surround subject loyalty. We have increased the impact of opinion on subject loyalty by 50%. This is huge. If you treat subjects poorly, they might hate you. You cannot just rely on military strength to keep them in line anymore. Diplomacy matters more. And the second point of change surrounds diseases. We have fixed a bug where some disease outbreaks were technically neverending. So if your population has been stuck in a permanent state of plague, help is on the way. We

[00:07:13 - 00:08:12] also tweaked levy reinforcement rate, lowering the threshold to recruit new levies to 20%, making it much less punishing if you lose a few battalions in a skirmish. So to summarize, 1.0.8 is live with the economy rework. There is currently an open beta 1.0.10 10 and that's focused on building roads and tearing down palaces as we address both proximity and the nobles. It's a lot to take in, but it's an exciting time to be playing. As always, if you are diving into the open beta, please head to the

[00:07:42 - 00:08:34] forums and report your bugs. We've said it time and time again, but the jump from hundreds of testers to tens of thousands of players is always going to be a real test for a game like this. Things will break, and it's your reports that are the reason that we can act so fast and implement hot fixes such as we did with 1.0. 0.9. Now, as we leave off, I want to know from you. Are you happy with the nobles nerf? Are you planning to pave your entire empire with roads now that there's been a buff? Although,

[00:08:08 - 00:08:55] I think I was doing that already. Let me know in the comments down below. Thank you so much for watching, and don't forget to subscribe to keep up with the absolute avalanche of updates and news. We've got some pretty exciting community content, and we're still taking name suggestions for this show. So, head over to that post or the comments of this video to let me know your suggestion. I'm personally really playing with the idea of calling it Tinto TV. But anyway, I'm Alex and until next time, be

[00:08:31 - 00:08:34] ambitious.
