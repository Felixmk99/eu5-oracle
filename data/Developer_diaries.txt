Instead of releasing developer diaries only in the relatively short amount of time between announcing and releasing the game, there were regular
Tinto Talks
,
Tinto Flavor
,
Tinto Maps
,
Tinto Flags
, and Saturday building posts about the game
Project Caesar
before and after it was announced as
Europa Universalis V
. The goal of these posts was to gather player feedback early enough in the development process that the game could be adapted to the feedback.
[1]
After the game's release date was announced, "regular" developer diaries were posted as well.

"Well, from a development perspective communicating with the players is extremely beneficial, as it provides us with feedback. But if it's so late in the development process that you can not adapt to the feedback, then a development diary is "just" a marketing tool."
