The Arianiti family was one of the major Albanian noble houses during the late Middle Ages.
Their lands were primarily located in central Albania, stretching roughly between the Shkumbin River and the Vjosa River, with centers around Kanina, Skrapar, and Elbasan. Over time, their influence extended into parts of Myzeqe and Dibër.
Not necessarily all the Arianiti people mentioned in various 11-14th century sources belong to the same family tree, however from them it is safe to assume that the Arianiti family was an important noble family of Medieval Central Albania. The importance of such family stemmed from the possession and control of important segments of the Royal Road (Via Egnatia) which served multiple convoys trading grain, salt and other products. The Arianiti family must have had the collaboration of the Pavle Kurtik, whose domain were in the provinces middle course of Shkumbin, and with župan Andrea Gropa, ruler of the city of Ochrid. The dominant position of the fortress of Ochrid, on the whole area of a very rich lake with high quality fish, had made his possession was the focus of political and military actions of the gods of the areas nearby.
