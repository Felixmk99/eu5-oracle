The nations in the Low Countries have been bounded and bossed around by both the
Kingdom of France
or the
Holy Roman Empire
since their creation, often becoming a fief of one or the other and not rarely switching sides. Like a big prize waiting for a claimant, as one of the richest regions in Europe, the countries of the region are in a position where they have to decide whether they will become an integral part of other nations or will defend their independence with fury.
Despite starting out as a dismal swamp, the County of Holland has slowly emerged as a serious contender for regional supremacy. The arrival of the Avesnes dynasty has brought us advantageously closer to the
County of Hainaut
, and our plans for expansion put the tantalizing the
Republic of Frisia
directly in our path. However, conflict between our
Adel and our
Burgerij seem to be reigniting, which is always bad for business...
