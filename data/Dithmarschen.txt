The Peasants of Dithmarschen
The lands cared for by our Peasants receive little attention from the outside world which has led to the development of self-organizing communities, far removed from the influence of any Nobles. Maybe it is time to shed the last remaining ties that bind us to the feudal society of Europe and embrace the structures of the Peasant Republic that have guided us for centuries.
