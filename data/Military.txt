Armies and navies can only enter another country's borders during a war. If they are still within another country's borders after a peace treaty has been signed, the army or navy will be marked as In Exile. They will be unable to siege or fight until they have returned to their own country's borders.
After a unit has moved at least half of the distance between two adjacent locations, its movement towards the destination location will be locked and cannot be changed.
If a unit has more than 40 regiments or ships, it will lose
-2%
Speed for every one above 40, up to a maximum penalty of
-50%
.
During a war, the unit UI will display whether the unit is visible to the opposing side or not.
Navies move 3 times faster than armies.

Every army and navy has a morale, which shows how long it will fight before leaving the battle. In battle, every regiment or ship inflicts morale damage upon its opponent, which can be increased or reduced by a variety of factors. Once morale hits zero, the army, or navy will retreat. Morale will slowly recover if the unit is not in combat or moving.

Drill Army unit ability after it has been researched.

Levies
[

edit source
]
Levies are military units that can be raised from the remaining manpower when the country is at war or facing rebels. Raising levies reduces population by an amount equal to the raised soldiers or ships, and disbanding levies will increase population by an amount equal to the remaining levies. Hovering over the button to raise levies will list all locations where levies will be raised from. Levies will only be raised from pops whose estates have at least
25%
[1]
estate satisfaction, but a higher satisfaction will not increase the amount of levies. Estates who are below the threshold will not contribute any levies.
Levies are generally less efficient than regulars and even more in later ages.
Army levies have the modifier

−10%
Discipline

Monthly Experience Decay
Navy levies have the modifier

A location in which levies have been raised gains the modifier

There are multiple types of levies that can be raised, depending on the pop used to raise them.

Mercenaries
[

edit source
]
Mercenaries are private individuals who take part in military conflict for
Gold, but are otherwise outsiders to the conflict. The base cost of Mercenaries is 50% higher than regulars.
A country that is at peace can make its own units available for hire to other countries as mercenaries. The country will set up the
Gold fee and duration in months of the contract.
If a mercenary unit is inside or next to another country's borders, the other country can bribe them to switch sides by paying 5 times their
Gold fee.
In addition to mercenaries made available by countries, each country can hire mercenary leaders from among the characters in any nearby country to raise a mercenary army. The types and amounts of units a mercenary leader can raise depends on what is available for recruitment in the character's country of origin. Hiring mercenary leaders costs 50 Gold, increased by the mercenary leader's abilities. The cost is also affected by the mercenary leader's opinion of the hiring country's primary culture and religion.
