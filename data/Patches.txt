Patches and hotfixes are updates from
Paradox Interactive
for
Europa Universalis V
:
Major patches
generally introduce new features or content, fix many bugs, and implement larger balance changes. They are often released alongside new
DLC
; when this occurs, some new features and content are restricted to owners of the DLC. Major patches typically increment the second number of the version.
Minor patches
generally fix a number of bugs and implement smaller balance changes. Minor patches are commonly released after major patches to address balance or minor issues discovered after the release of a major patch. Minor patches typically increment the third number of the version.
Hotfixes
are generally timely fixes for critical issues, such as crashes or major gameplay bugs. They may include other balance or feature changes as well. Hotfixes are commonly released shortly after major patches to fix any unforeseen bugs, or independently to fix newly-discovered bugs or exploits. Hotfixes typically increment the third number of the version.
Note:
Most DLC cannot be activated if playing on a patch version preceding the DLC's release. This also applies to mods, which have various levels of compatibility with different patches.

Checksum

Each patch has an associated checksum that allows to verify the installation is correct.
It is displayed in multiple places:
In the main menu and the Join Game screen in the bottom right.
In the Host Game screen, under the Game Info tab in the top right.
After creating a multiplayer game, under Game Settings tab on the left.
If your checksum is different from the official patch checksum, it may be due to one of the following:
One or more mods are active
The game is in debug mode
One or more game files have been changed or corrupted
Rollback
[

Patches, especially major ones, can introduce anomalies or incompatibilities with save files from older versions. In this case, if playing on Steam, a player can roll back to a previous version in order to preserve their current playthrough.
On Steam, right-click on the game in your library and select "Properties" then "Betas".
In the "Select the beta you would like to opt-in" dropdown, choose any available past version of the game. Not all versions are available.
Note:
It is not possible to revert to an earlier version on other gaming platforms other than Steam (at this time).
