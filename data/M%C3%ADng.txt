Historical background

The Yuán dynasty of China would be established by Kublai Khan in 1279 and would fall less than 100 years later in 1368. The decline would begin in the 1330s due to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, famines, military decline, factional strife and growing resentment from Han Chinese due to Mongol supremacist policies. These factors would result in the outbreak of the Red Turban Rebellion from 1351 - 1368, which lead to the establishment of the Míng dynasty of China under Zhū Yuán Zhāng, who would become the Hongwu Emperor on the 23rd of January 1368. The Hongwu Emperor would continue his campaigns against Yuán until the campaign into Manchuria and subsequent conquest of Liaodong in 1387. Yuán would continue to exist as the Northern Yuán in Mongolia until their conquest in 1635 by the
Later Jīn
, who later became the
Qīng
dynasty.
The Hongwu Emperor would establish the Huang-Ming Zuxun, a set of dynastic instructions aimed at guiding his descendants on how to rule China. He would grant his sons and grandsons many titles across China. This backfired after his death, as his successor the Jianwen Emperor would be overthrown by the Prince of Yan in 1402, who became the Yongle Emperor. The Yongle Emperor would oversee the establishment of Běijīng - formerly named Dàdū - as the northern imperial capital with the construction of the Forbidden City. He would also oversee the treasure voyages of Muslim eunuch Zheng He who would venture as far west as Africa. Míng would face a crisis in 1449 after the capture of the Yingzong Emperor by
Oirat
, who would be reinstated in 1457 in a coup. This crisis would result in a strengthening of the Great Wall, bringing it to it's modern form. During the Míng era, empire-wide censuses were conducted every 10 years, providing large amounts of data for Confucian bureaucrats and eunuchs to govern the empire with.
Míng would weaken and decline in the later 16th and early 17th centuries with the
Little Ice Age
causing crop failures, a disruption in supply of imported Portuguese and Spanish silver resulting in huge price increases, flooding and a Black Plague epidemic. These factors would result in rebellion and weakening of the military which would allow the invading Later Jīn to proclaim the Qīng dynasty in 1636 and conquer Běijīng from a rebel prince in 1644. The Qīng would go on to conquer all of China and finally conquer the last remnants of Míng in 1683 with the surrender of Taiwan.

To become Míng, the player must start as Yuán and pick the option "I wonder what might the future hold for Míng" in the Red Turban Rebellion event "The Rise of Míng". Míng starts in a good position to conquer its neighbouring warring states and the rest of China from Yuán, owing to the many buffs Míng receives. Míng will quickly annex its neighbour
Guō
via the event "King Guō Zi Xìn's Untimely Demise".
