The Kingdom of Sicily is officially known as Trinacria as the mainland possessions of the kingdom are under the tyranny of the Angevins of
Naples
. The old Norman kingdom was divided after the War of the Sicilian Vespers between the Aragonese and Angevins. Historically, the pearl of the Mediterranean would lose its significance as a territory of the Crown of
Aragon
and later the
Spanish
Empire. However, under a player's auspicious rule Sicily can once again become the center of the Mediterranean world, reclaim mainland Sicily, invade
Tunisia
to restore the ephemeral Norman Kingdom of
Africa
, or even unite the
Italian Peninsula
.
