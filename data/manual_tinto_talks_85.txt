(Note: This is a summary of the extracted dev diary content regarding modding in EU5)

Modding Philosophy: EU5 is built on the Jomini Framework (similar to Victoria 3 and CK3), offering advanced scripting and localized GUI capabilities.

Early Access for Mods: Several popular mods like Anbennar, Extended Timeline, Imperium Universalis, and Europa Expanded have had early access to ensure they can begin development before the game's official release.

New Systems: Showcasing the scripting syntax for events, "Situations" (like the Rise of Ulm or the Reconquista), and International Organizations.

Tool Support: Developers of community tools such as Arcanum (a specialized editor), Pdx.Tools (a save analyzer), and Pdx-Unlimiter are already preparing support for EU5.

Fun Additions: A developer even implemented a fully functional Minesweeper mod within the EU5 engine in just 11 hours, highlighting the game's improved modding efficiency and features like "file watchers" that allow for live updates without restarting.
