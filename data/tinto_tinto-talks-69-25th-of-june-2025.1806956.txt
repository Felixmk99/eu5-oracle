Tinto Talks #69 - 25th of June 2025
Thread starter

Start date

Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today we will talk about two situations that impact Italy in the first 200 years of the game: the
Guelphs & Ghibellines
and
The Italian Wars
. They’re kind of related, but independent in how they play. Let’s start without further ado:
Guelphs & Ghibellines
​
Some of you may remember the ‘Shadow Empire’ incident of EU4, where the Emperor ‘races’ to keep the Italian countries inside the HRE. However, one century earlier, the political landscape of Italy was more complex in that regard, as two main political factions had been fighting for around 200 years: the Guelphs, defenders of the Pope, and the Ghibellines, supporters of the Imperial power.
As you can see, Italy starts already divided into these two factions, Guelphs and Ghibellines, with their own leaders - Naples for the Guelphs, and Milan for the Ghibellines. Two months after the start of the game, you’ll get the event ‘The Political Landscape of Italy’, which starts the situation, and a few days later, this one that allows you to realign early on:
This is the situation itself, with a map of its starting factions if the player doesn’t change (as the AI will stay in their starting faction by default):
Note: Some tweaks regarding the coloring still need to be done.
​
The situation revolves around diplomacy - each faction will try to get as many Italian countries to join its faction, either by peace or by war:
As you may have seen in the panel, some actions can be performed, which are slightly different depending on which faction you belong to:
To end the situation, you need to have 100% Progress achieved for your faction. If the Age of Discovery starts (in 1437) without one of the factions having won over the other, a stalemate will happen:
There are 3 different outcomes for the situation:
If the Guelphs win, all countries with a capital in the Italy region will be forced to leave the HRE
If the Ghibellines win, all countries, except Naples, Sicily, the Papal States, or the Two Sicilies, will be forced to join the HRE
If neither side can achieve 100% Progress before the Age of Discovery starts, whoever is in the Guelphs will either stay out or leave the HRE, and whoever is in the Ghibellines will stay in the HRE.
This is an example of the ending event for the ‘Stalemate Outcome’.
​
The Italian Wars
​
The Italian Wars is a situation that may be triggered if the Holy Roman Emperor, or a French or Iberian foreign power (which is defined here by either being a Great Power in game terms, being of Kingdom rank, or having at least 5M pops) attacks a country in the Italian region after the Age of Discovery has started:
As you can see, three Foreign Leagues, one centered around each region (HRE, France, and Iberia), will be formed, while three Italian Leagues will also be formed. The chosen countries are those regarded as more powerful in each region:
Note: I forced the situation through console commands, so the RNG gifted us with a regent in France, and the main countries chosen as League Leaders were quite similar to those more powerful in 1337.
​
As you can see, there’s also a mix of diplomacy and war that can be conducted to ‘attract’ other countries into your sphere - you can either do diplomatic actions to invite them, or you can conquer them through force to incorporate them into your League.
The situation can end either if any League controls or has the support of at least 200 locations in Italy, or if 50 years after the start of the Italian Wars, the Foreign Leagues don’t have any locations in Italy.
The results may be the following:
And that’s all for today! We will come back on Friday, as we will talk in
Tinto Flavour
, about two Italian countries,
Milan
and
Naples
.
And also remember, you can
wishlist Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

So does it have any lasting consequences or just a temporary modifier?

So is there any flavor or event or decision for who wins the Italian wars? Apart from the prestige gain and special modifier
What if an Italian power wins, anything special happens or no

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them

With the pictures of Oversiplified, I hope that there will be some event in game, which will mention the bucket incident.

Mantua should be part of the Ghibellines at the start since after a coup in 1328 Ludovico I Gonzaga who was a supporter of the Emperor became de facto Signore of the city

In the Guelphs & Ghibellines situation, it says score is determined by the number of tags in each group. Does that mean we're disinsentivised from attacking fellow ghelp factions? Thereby suggesting we don't expand? Might it not be better if it's done by number of locations under the control of all Guelphs & Ghibellines tags, like the Italian Wars

Quickly noticed the name order is displayed correctly here. Also the name and title/nickname have different shades.
I'd still want the flag and the CoA to center align as well.

Why would I, as an Italian republic in the HRE, want other Italian republics to join the HRE?
Is there anything bigger as a reward as a foreigner involving myself in the Italian leagues if I win? 20 prestige and some minor modifiers for only 10 years hardly seems like a worthwhile rewards for having a 'strong grasp on Italy'. Vassalizations or permanent modifiers is something I would bother with, but this doesn't seem like it's worth it vs all the other things I could spend my limited diplomatic capacity on.

I notice that in screenshots of this TT, the animation/pose/emotion of character models look different to previous screenshots, and the new animation looks weird to me.
May I ask what happened?

Regarding the Guelph and Ghibelines situation, you mentioned "diplomacy" being a tool usable to get the other side to join you, can you ask a country to join you with bribes ? Also, i hope you can't leave a faction for X years after being forced within it through war (or even bribe I'd say).
Also, are both sides progress "pitted" one against the other (i.e, the sum of both is equal to 100%) or is it a race to be the first reaching 100% ?
Finally, I'd say the outcome could be slightly different, it'd be imo better that it can eventually be negotiated between the HRE emperor and the pope, eventually giving a change of faction for X countries. That or that a country with 100% progress can trigger the "end of the situation" whenever it wants. And when it ends (no matter how precisely), all guelphs get out of the HRE and all ghibelines stay within, eventually giving all (catholics) guelphs a fair bit of religious fervor, or even a pemanent religious bonus.
