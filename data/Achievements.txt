international organization
Play as the Minor Tribe of Yehe, they are the strongest individual tribe with Jurchen culture. Break away from your Jurchen Confederation and wait for the
Red Turban Rebellions
, which has an event that breaks the Yuan subjugation of all Jurchen tribes. Once you are free, declare war on your former federation leader, Minor Tribe of Hada, and annex all their land to gain access to their Horse and Silver provinces in order to turbo boost your economy. From here focus on conquering as much land and subjugate as many tribes as you can. When you feel its time to fight Great Yuan (they are much weaker than one would imagine since all their vassals are disloyal), simply build a spy network and fabricate a CB to take the Mandate of Heaven and declare a war using that CB, it allows you to take control of the Middle Kingdom through the peace deal. Can be done before year 1450 without declaring a single no-CB war.
H
A Pile of Gold
Own 35 locations which produce gold or silver.
Own at least 35 locations producing either:

Silver
The
Great Yuán
owns 33 locations that produce gold or silver at the start of the game. The neighboring
Chagatai Horde
is a good target for an early war of conquest as they, together with their subjects, own seven locations producing the required goods.
Colonizing the gold-producing locations of the East Siberia region, which starts as Terra Incognita, is another option.
The very easy way to get this achievement, would be to use the ''Settle Tribesman'' Cabinet Action in the provinces Shilka and Amur all the way in the North, on the Manchu-Mongolian Region border. Labourers start appearing when the province reaches 500 peasants. This should get you the achievement before the event fires that turns unintegrated Manchuria back to uncolonized.
