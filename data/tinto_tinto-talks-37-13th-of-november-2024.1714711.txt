Tinto Talks #37 - 13th of November 2024
Thread starter

Start date
Nov 13, 2024
Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinto Talks. This is the Happy Wednesday, the day of the week where we tell you information about our super secret game with the code name Project Caesar.
This week we will talk about art and culture; not why it's important to the world, but the impact it has in our game. To begin with, every Culture in Project Caesar has two important attributes: Cultural Influence and Cultural Tradition.
Cultural Influence
This is the attack power of a culture in the context of culture war, representing how impressive it appears to other cultures, and the reach it has beyond its own borders.
It has a monthly increase depending on prestige, some cultural buildings and also increases upon the completion of a work of art.
The influence of the English is weak… for now..
Cultural Tradition
This is the defense power of a culture in the context of culture war, representing how strongly this culture's traditions resonate with its people.
Tradition has a monthly change dependent on relevant buildings, but also on the amount of art you have in your country. The average literacy of your nobles also have a significant impact on your cultural tradition as well.
Some nested tooltips, you can also see the details of every location by hovering over that value as well..
As you may see in the screenshot above, the primary culture of the country is the one benefiting from your art and nobles.
Culture War
So what is cultural influence and cultural tradition impacting then. Well, we have this concept called Culture War which impacts several aspects of the game. For the part where culture is relevant, the cultural influence of the “attacking” culture is compared against the cultural tradition of the “defending” culture.  If it's positive you will get bonuses, but if it's negative, you will face penalties.
There are plenty of diplomatic actions where having a dominant culture is a benefit for the other country to accept your deals, not to mention the fact that building a spy network is far faster if you have a cultural dominance.
This also has an impact if you have conquered some land and want to integrate it, as if your cultural influence is bigger than their traditions you will integrate the territory faster. This is also valid if you want to annex a subject.
You also assimilate people faster if you have a higher cultural influence than the pop’s culture’s traditions. There is also a small impact on sieges as well.
Cultural Investment
One of the most important advances in the Age of Renaissance is the ‘Patron of the Arts’, this one is early in the part of the tree that requires the Renaissance Institution, and it allows you to invest into culture. The cost of this depends on the size of the economy and how many artists you wish to employ.
How can you be a renaissance man without sponsoring the arts?
There is a direct impact from the investment you make each month on your prestige as well as an impact on the skill of the artists and the art they create.
There are some countries outside of Europe that already start with advances that unlock investing into culture.
Artists
These are characters that appear in countries that are investing into culture. They will spend their time creating new art, or figuring out what art they should create. They will also increase their skill over time, depending on how much money you will throw at them.  If you get frustrated with them not producing new art, you can always commission art directly by throwing even more money at them.
Various buildings and advances can impact the skill floor and ceiling of a new artist as well.
One artist that exists at the start of the game..
If you have less than double the number of the supported artists in your country, you can always poach an artist from a smaller and less rich country. That artist will then move to your country and all the art they create will benefit you, however the influence of the culture of the country you invited him from will increase.
There are several different types of artists, and they create different types of art.
Painter
This type of artist creates images by depicting the world or purely from their imagination. It is done by applying pigment, coal or other sources of colors to a solid surface like a canvas or a wall. Famous painters of the era include Leonardo Da Vinci, Rembrandt, and Raphael.
Sculptor
A sculptor shapes clay, stone, marble, wood, and other materials into art. Famous sculptors of the era include Donatello, Michelangelo, and Gianlorenzo Bernini.
Composer
This is an artist that creates music, including anything from a motet to a symphony. Famous composers of the era include Johan Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Carl Michael Bellman.
Writer
A writer describes artists that can write anything from a poem to a novel, as well as writing entire plays. Famous writers of the era include William Shakespeare and many more of lesser talent.
Architect
Architects are the artists that design the buildings that create the beauty of our cities. This also includes monuments, mansions and palaces. Famous architects of the era include Minar Sinan, Christopher Wren, and Michelangelo.
Philosopher
This type of artist defines reality and helps us shape our understanding of our existence. Famous philosophers of the era include René Descartes, Immanuel Kant, and Baruch Spinoza.
Jurist
An expert in legal matters, proficient in analyzing and commenting on the different legal codes. Famous Jurists of the era include Bartolus de Saxoferrato, Francisco de Vitoria, and Jeremy Bentham.
Scientist
A person of knowledge and a scholar of thought, questioning the aspects of nature which have been granted as given in the past. Famous Scientists of the era include Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, and Joseph Fourier.
Iconographer - Only for certain religions
Iconographers create religious icons. Famous iconographers of the era include Eulalios, Georgios Kallergis, and Manuel Panselinos.
Metalsmith - if you have metallurgy
Metalsmiths are skilled artificers, capable of creating anything from decorative weapons to kingly regalia. Famous metalsmiths of the era include Johann Joseph Würth, Vidal Astori, and Jehan Cambier.
Works of Art
A work of art is something that an artist has created. When the art is created, it will directly increase the cultural influence of the primary culture of the country that the artist is working in. Not all artists will necessarily live in a capital, or create their art there either.
There is of course art already present at the start of the game..
When a location is conquered through a siege or normal occupation, there is a chance for Works of Art to be looted or destroyed. If it's looted, it will be transferred to your capital, so you can create a nice Museum a few centuries later. Having some art in your country has some benefits, increasing your prestige and traditions.
You might become more innovative if you have lots of art though..
There is also a direct benefit to all locations that have works of art as well, depending on how much of the art you have, and it provides some good benefits.
A true melting pot..
Prestige
This is a concept that has existed in many of our previous GSG and it is present on Project Caesar as well. Here it's a value between 0 and 100 and will decay to 0 if nothing else increases it, where the decay is bigger the higher the prestige is.
Prestige in this game is heavily tied to the cultural part of the game, but it also has an impact on diplomacy and trade.
If the nobles were just a little bit more happy…
Stay tuned, as next week we will go into detail about all the societal values we have.

Will Extraterritorial Countries have a specific cultures, or will their culture depend on the culture where the buildings are placed?
If it is the latter, won't expanding be challenging, as you will need to accept a lot more cultures than for regular countries.
Can you declare war on Extraterritorial Countries, and what would it mean to, for example, vassalize a banking country, if you can do so?

Mmm.... on one hand I'd like to be assimilated into French, because of the standard of living and my starving stomach, but on the other hand, I heard the English have some really good plays. Decisions, decisions....
Also, I see PDX has been hanging in that weird part of Youtube... >.<

Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. Defend me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. The mighty are gathered against me, awake to help me, and behold.
Nor is there pain, or cause of pain, Or cease in pain, or noble path to lead from pain;
The Master said, "Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?"
Do not despair of the mercy of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, and the name that can be named is not the eternal Name.
It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect it;
The finest essence here—that constitutes the self of this whole world; that is the truth; that is the self.
O Son of Man! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient eternity of My essence, I knew My love for thee; therefore I created thee, have engraved on thee Mine image and revealed to thee My beauty.
Rise up for me, O Ahura, through Armaiti give strength, through the holiest Spirit give might, O Mazda, through the good Recompense, through the Right give powerful prowess, through Good Thought give the reward.
O my mind, remember the Lord in meditation; He is the Destroyer of pain, the Eradicator of fear, the Sovereign Lord King. He is the Greatest Lover, the Merciful Master, the Enticer of the mind, the Support of His devotees - this is His very nature.
In some ways, it is, in some ways, it is not, in some ways, it is, and it is not, in some ways, it is indescribable, in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable, in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable, in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable.
So be diligent in seeking knowledge, keeping company with those of understanding, and studying at all times, and you will attain goodness and blessings.
An ash I know there stands, - Yggdrasill is its name, - a tall tree, showered - with shining loam. - From there come the dews - that drop in the valleys. - It stands forever green over - Urðr's well.
Our God, with His mercy - Brought for us beauty and loveliness - He gave a command to the Pen of Power - We were thrown into the Mystery of Love.
I saw my father, I saw him, and I gave him three requests. I asked him for a great heart, which can be carried by the big and the little. I asked him for calmness, in which there is no rebellion. I asked him for a level path, to rise to light’s place in peace.

Brilliant!
A couple of questions on
assimilation
:
1. Will cultural assimilation be separated from language assimilation or will they be linked together?
2. Is assimilation natural after the conquest or can it be only forced by a cabinet action/member?
3. I think
different cultures can be assimilated with different efficiency (speed)
and
some 'distant' cultures cannot be assimilated at all
. E.G. as Spain you can easily assimilate other Romance pops, with German/Baltic/Slavic it would take longer, with Arab, Berber MUCH longer, with African, Asian, Native American, Australian - almost never.
Is it reflected somehow?
Thanks!

Civ 6 ahh feature. Didn't know we needed great works and tourism in EU but honestly now I'm pretty intrigued. Could potentially be really fun and it's another thing to do besides war, which is always a plus.

Can a country be fully focused on cultural investment ? Is it profitable to invest a lot of money in this field or are the benefits limited ?

Interesting. How static/dynamic are the artists and works of art? Will the renaissance always result in the same artists in Italy and Balgium, regardless of who occupies the land or how the development is, etc?
