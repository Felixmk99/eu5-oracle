Tinto Talks #77 - 20th of August 2025
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Aug 20, 2025
Hello everyone, and welcome to another Happy Wednesday where we talk about features for Europa Universalis V - which, you may now be aware of, already has a release date, November 4th!
Today, we will go through a few UI building blocks we use in EU5, where some are blocks that you are familiar with, and some are completely new.
Tooltips
First of all, the Paradox classic, the tooltip. Without the tooltip, I suspect the games would not be even remotely playable. This game is not different in this aspect, but we have taken a few extra steps to make it even better. We have been basing our tooltip design heavily around the nested tooltip systems that we first used in Crusader Kings III.
As this game is a bit complex, we try to clarify a fair bit of words and what they mean in our game. Those words, which we internally call game concepts, are colored blue and can be tool-tipped, giving a small explanation about them.
Wait until the end o
f this post to see what a Hint is…
As we often have values with a lot of sources impacting them, they become harder to read, but in EU5, we have switched to using tables in tooltips whenever
That is a nice policy in the Maritime Law.
A final thing we have in tooltips is the actions, so it shows what will happen when you click on a button with a left mouse button and/or right mouse button icon.
We got a quick action here to right-click to do some relevant actions.
If the action is not possible, there is a small condition block in the tooltip showing why.
Ah, yes, this is too expensive, as our Nobles are too powerful...
Outliner
This is a building block we have used for almost two decades to have quick tracking of armies, constructions, and other things in progress. In EU5, we now have two versions of the outliner, where you can have a simpler one if you feel the normal one is too noisy.
It's a quick way to select units and change things on the fly.
And of course, we got settings so you can toggle what you want to be able to see:
Right-Click Menus
As with many of our games, we have context-sensitive right-click menus that appear when you right-click locations, countries, characters, or units. This can save you some time doing things you wish to do quickly.
The menu below is what we get when right-clicking on a foreign location on the map; the bottom buttons allow you to get location, province, and area-specific actions instead.
And you can directl
y see their current opinion, trust, favors, and your spynetwork..
When right-clicking a unit, you get a menu like this, and the menu won't close if you just click a toggle.
Alert
One thing that we have been using in our GSGs for a long time is the alert system. We first introduced it in the Revolutions DLC for the original Victoria almost twenty years ago.  In EU4 we had 3 different colored alerts, but here we have added 3 new colors.
The orange alert is between the yellow and red in danger.
The blue alert, which is for pure UI hints, like a tutorial notification, or not having a control group.
The purple alert for situations and disasters.
You can always discard an alert if you think it's noisy, and it will only appear again if the conditions change.
Messages
Another classic that has been with us since the original Europa Universalis back at the start of the millennium is our message system, where every message in the game can be configured to show in the news log, be shown as a pop-up with pause or not, or be shown as a text message on the map.
The little button at the top right allows you to configure how you want to display it.
Each message has a category as well, making it easier to configure.
Search and Filters
One of the new systems we have developed for Europa Universalis V is our concept of search and filters for every list of elements in the game. The search bar allows you to search for anything in the list, like listing buildings with a specific modifier, or finding something by a partial name match.
Filters also allow you to toggle on what should be displayed in the list, and you can toggle any selection of filters.
Another good thing with the filters is that you can easily go from, let's say, a selected location, and then click the population number there, and it will go to the population view with that location as a filter.
Mapmode Color Ledgers
Another cool thing we have added to the game is a color ledger for most map modes, so you can see what the colors actually mean.  We have added a button next to the current mapmode so you can toggle it at any time.
Hints
Finally, we have our Hints system. This can be accessed from the top left menu, but you can also shift-click alerts and many buttons in the game to get a specific hint relevant to it.
A hint has a few flavorful quotes at the top, where the characters with the best stats you have in your country will give you their advice on the selected hint. This was, of course, inspired by the advisors of
Civilization 2.
You also get an explanation of the reason for the hint, and a few suggestions for actions you can take to alleviate or remove the problem. Any yellow text here is clickable and will take you to the panel where you can do something about it.
This can be really helpful to teach you the game mechanics…
And that’s all for today! I hope that this helps to understand how we’ve been building the UI systems of the game, to be as helpful for the player as possible, and make them robust in the long term.
And also remember, you can
Pre-Purchase Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

Thank you so much for taking into consideration our proposals! I am certain that EU5 will be the best game you have made yet.
However, I think I should reiterate that many people dislike the huge portrait of the ruler in the top left of the screen, in some ways obfuscating the national flag. I hope that is something one can toggle.

Hi, I'd like to point out two UI issues from today’s screenshot:
These icons look too large
and take up a considerable portion of the screen in the centre. It’s distracting every time I see it. I believe many people have suggested moving them to the corner, similar to EU4. It would be interesting to know your reasoning at least.
Although there has been a huge improvement since May,
Barcelona still looks a bit oversized
and occupies most of the location (except for that coastal strip to the north). I think the city image should not extend beyond the location border and should instead be
limited to a set number of pixels from the borders
to avoid this.
Thanks!

Please Johan, could I get mapname and "UI" name for the same location be different by Modding, for aesthetical purposes?

This may have been answered before, but will EU5 have EU4 style ledgers that can be used to "size up" other countries?

One big UI issue is with that the IO/control group buttons were in the bottom-center of the screen, hovering in a really awkward location. Any chance those have been moved somewhere better, like a corner of the screen, rather than right in the middle of everything?
Edit: Oh, wait. They're still in the same place...
Is there at least an option to have these somewhere else? I don't want to just remove them, but I don't want them in the center of my screen. Even just three of these looks really irritating, nevermind like five, or more.

As I said in the last feedback post, the UI is looking a lot better - though some better alignment on the ledgers with the sorting categories would be nice. One thing that I do really dislike about the UI is the location of these IO/Control-Group buttons:

I really hate where they are on the screen. Please tell me there are options to move them somewhere less irritating, like a corner of the screen?
I don't want to disable them, but I really don't want them hovering in the center-bottom of the screen, they're in such a bad position and I can definitely see them getting in the way constantly.

By the way, do rural locations require a
citadel
to be built to be promoted to a town? That would require some money for maintenance and would be realistic to
prevent town spamming everywhere as a meta
.
Also it would be more historically accurate and would
slow down fast expansion
when wars are won in 1 day by occupying the nearby ULM capital.
I think all towns should have
X
fort levels and all cities (
X
+
Y
) fort levels (
X
> 0,
Y
> 0).

The category section of the outliner blends in too much, please consider fully colouring them in.

I was thinking mostly in terms of military, which I don't really see there, unless it is hidden under Wars? Compare the EU4 military ledger:
