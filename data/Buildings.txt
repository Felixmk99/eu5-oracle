Buildings
Common buildings
Rural buildings
Urban buildings
Buildings have a wide variety of different functions, from manufacturing
Goods
to unlocking unique unit types. Their efficiency is based on how many
Pops
are currently
Employed
there.
Each building has one or more Production Methods, which determine its input and output. If a building does not get enough market resources for its production method, the output will decrease by a percentage equal to the missing goods.
Estates may also construct buildings and their construction cannot be canceled. Hovering over an estate will display what is the next building they want to construct and where. Destroying a building that was constructed by an estate will reduce the estate's Satisfaction.
Overlords can begin the construction of buildings in locations owned by their subjects. The overlord will pay the
Gold cost but the construction materials must be supplied from the location's market. Overlords cannot cancel the construction of subject buildings even if they started the construction.
The construction of buildings can be automated. In the automation menu a minimum amount of
Gold can be set before construction becomes automated.
Building cost

Most buildings have an upfront construction cost in
Gold and require certain goods while they are constructed. If not enough goods are supplied, construction will pause. The base
Gold cost is the following:
50 if the building is unlocked by an advance from the
Age of Traditions or is not unlocked by an advance
100 if the building is unlocked by an advance from the
Age of Renaissance
200 If the building is unlocked by an advance from the
Age of Discovery
400 If the building is unlocked by an advance from the
Age of Reformation
800 If the building is unlocked by an advance from the
Age of Absolutism
1200 If the building is unlocked by an advance from the
Age of Revolutions
Certain buildings have their cost quadrupled for their age
A few buildings use a predefined cost instead of the aforementioned ones
The cost is then affected by the price of the construction goods in the location's market.
Building levels
[

Many buildings can be constructed multiple times in a location, and for almost all of them the amount of times it can be constructed scales with the location's population.
Every location has a Building Levels value. Every building above that cap increases the building cost in the location by
+5%
. The number of Building Levels in a location is the following:
+1
per point of Development
+25
if location rank is Town
+100
if location rank is City
+5
if location is a country capital
+5
if location is a market center
Employment system

Each country has an employment system, which is found in the Production tab and determines how locations fill their buildings with workers. Changing the employment system costs 10
Stability. There are four possible employment systems:
Equality
: Buildings are filled in equal proportions with the employees available. Adds
+0.1
monthly progress to Communalism.
First Come, First Serve
: Buildings are filled in the order they were built. Adds
+0.1
monthly progress to Traditional Economy.
Most Profitable First
: Buildings are filled in order of which makes the most profit. Adds
+0.1
monthly progress to Capital Economy.
Infrastructure, then Most Profitable
: Buildings are filled infrastructure first, then in order of which makes the most profit. Adds
+0.05
monthly progress to Communalism and Capital Economy.
Potential profit
[

Every building has a Potential Profit, which is calculated by comparing the selling price of the produced goods against the market price of the input goods for the production method. The selling price of goods is normally the amount produced (which is modified by the availability of input goods, the production efficiency and the employment level of the building) times their market price times the Market Access in the location.
If a building's Potential Profit is positive it will hire employees each month, provided there is sufficient population. If a building's Potential Profit is negative it will fire employees at a rate of 10% each month. The country can choose to give the building Subsidies, which will prevent firing of employees but also deduct any negative Potential Profit from the country's
Treasury
.
Food output
[

If a building outputs goods with a food value, it will contribute the amount of goods produced times the food value to the province's food. Unlike profit this is unaffected by market access, but it is instead modified by the location's food efficiency.
