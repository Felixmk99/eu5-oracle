Tinto Talks #65 - 28th of May 2025
Thread starter
Pavía
Start date
May 28, 2025
Hello, and welcome to another Tinto Talks, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will discuss the mechanics of Eastern Christianity religions. We have grouped them into three main religions:
Orthodoxy
,
Miaphysitism
, and
Nestorianism
. So, let’s start without further ado.
Orthodoxy
​
This is the overview of the Orthodox religion:
This tooltip needs some more love, as we’re not showing all the mechanics of the religion. That’s because, as usual, please consider all UI, 2D and 3D art WIP.
​
This is the country panel of the religion:
Countries of Orthodox religion in Autocephalous Patriarchates, which are a type of IO:
I’m taking here the Autocephalous Patriarchate of Constantinople, which has the custom name of ‘Ecumenical Patriarchate’, as an example.
​
And here you have the existing Orthodox Patriarchates in 1337:
Countries can Join an Autocephalous Patriarchate, if they’ve just converted to Orthodoxy; or, when they already belong to one, they can Change to a different one, or Create a new one:
The Seat of an Autocephalous Patriarchates defines the Leader of this IO, which unlocks additional effects and actions:
There are also some other blocks in the Autocephalous Patriarchate, as its Saints:
And Holy Sites:
The main currency of the religion is Religious Influence, which already appeared in the Catholic TT:
You can do a few things with your Religious Influence. First, you can canonize a former ruler, making him a Saint:
The benefits you get from the canonization scale with the ruler stats. So better to make sure that you want to canonize a truly memorable former ruler!
​
You can also call for a Synod in your country:
Finally, there’s a unique type of work of art, Icons:
These icons not only give a modifier to the location where they are, but also can be used in a ‘Periphora’ to another location:
Miaphysitism
​
Miaphysitism is similar to Orthodoxy, with some differences. Here is the overview of the religion itself:
Same as Orthodoxy, it also has the mechanics of Canonization and Autocephalous Patriarchates, with these ones being the Patriarchates present at start:
However, most of these are actually empty due to being occupied by Muslim countries, with only Ethiopia remaining as part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Alexandria and the Armenian patriarchate as the only one containing more than one country.
An integral part of each the Eastern Christians and their Patriarchates are their Tenets, defined in a series of laws:
The ‘Nature’ tenet is a hard–locked IO Law, that depends on each Religion:
These Tenets can be changed, and there are multiple possibilites in each Law:
Nestorianism
​
There is no country having Nestorianism as its state religion at game start, but the religion is nonetheless still quite spread in some areas. Here is an overview of it:
Nestorianism also has its own holy sites:
And also its specific definition of the nature of Christ:
A final remark on a common flavor for all these religions. First, they have their unique flavor monasteries:
The modifiers are WIP, we want to make them somewhat different.
​
There's a Law in which you can define the policy of the relationship between the state and the religion:
And that’s all for today! Tomorrow is Thursday, which means that we will publish a new ‘
Behind the Scenes
’ video, on Friday, we will discuss the
Byzantine Empire
in
Tinto Flavour,
and next Wednesday's Tinto Talks will be about Islam.
And also remember, you can
wishlist Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

Will
Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra
be a unique building or some kind of Holy See? Since it was the most ancient and important East Slavic Orthodox monastery.
Don't you have an event about the establishing of
Pochaiv Lavra
in South-East Volhynia? The second biggest and second most important Ruthenian Lavra (monastery).
EDIT
:
I'll transfer my Ruthenian Orthodox buildings and WoAs suggestions here.
_________
My suggestions on possible
Works of Art
and
unique buildings
(
ex-monuments in EU4
)
around Ruthenian lands
. They are Orthodox-related, so please, consider adding them.
These I consider as must-have (I compare with WoAs of Novgorod):
​
Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra – Kyiv
Unique building – monastery
Founded in 1051
The most important and influential Orthodox monastery in the East Slavic lands
Should provide some Orthodox benefits, literacy, cultural tradition/influence, clergy power
Wiki page
St. Sophia Cathedral – Kyiv
Work of Art – cathedral
Built between 1017 and 1037, survived the Mongolian invasion
The cathedral of Metropolitans of Kyiv
The most famous and important Kyivan cathedral
Wiki page
Transfiguration Cathedral – Chernihiv
Work of Art – cathedral
Built between 1030 and 1036 and survived the Mongolian invasion
One of the two oldest still existing Kyivan Rus churches (with St. Sophia in Kyiv)
Maybe even the oldest, could be build 1 – 2 years earlier than St. Sophia
Wiki page
Dormition Cathedral – Volodymyr-Volynskyi
(Volhynia)
Work of Art – cathedral
Built in 1160
Historic Volhynian eparchial cathedral and the 'heart' of Volhynian Orthodoxy
Wiki UA page
The Black Madonna – Belz (Volhynia)
a.k.a. The Black Madonna of
Częstochowa
Work of Art – icon
A famous Byzantine icon created around the VI – IX centuries
Later became the Black Madonna of Częstochowa
Was transferred from Belz to Częstochowa by Władysław Opolczyk in the 1380s
Legends trace the icon's origin to Luke the Evangelist
Poland could have a DHE and transfer it to Częstochowa if they take Belz
Wiki page
Dormition of the Mother of God – Kyiv
Work of Art – icon
It had been
the main icon of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra for 900 years
before being destroyed in 1941
It was brought as a gift by the Byzantine architects of the monastery in the XI century
The image shows one of the multiple later copies in a golden protective cover
kiot
The Primary Chronicle (or Tale of Bygone Years) – Kyiv
Work of Art – writing/literature(?)
A chronicle of Kyivan Rus from about 850 to 1110
It is believed to have been originally compiled in or near Kyiv in the 1110s
The work is considered a fundamental source for the earliest history of the East Slavs
There can be also a scripted dynamic event about
Pochaiv Lavra
around the XVI century in Kremenets
One of the three main monasteries (Lavras) of the East Slavic Orthodoxy
This could be a
unique building with a bit weaker benefits as Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra
​
Optional Works of Art depending on how many of them you give to different countries:
​
Church of
St. Panthelemon
– Halych
Work of Art – church
Built in 1194
The only Halych pre-mongolian church that survived to this day
Wiki UA page
The Kholm Madonna – Kholm/Chelm (Volhynia)
Work of Art – icon
An ancient Byzantine icon and the oldest
now in Ukraine
Was reportedly brought from Kyiv to Kholm between 1223 and 1237 by the future King of Ruthenia Danylo of Halych
Legends trace the icon's origin to Luke the Evangelist so it was highly valued in the society
Wiki UA page
Church of St. Anna – Uzhhorod (Hungary)
Work of Art – church
The precise age is unknown, but estimated around the X – XIII centuries
Wiki UA page
Looking forward!

Two questions.
1. So what's the difference between Orthodoxy and
Miaphysitism? Both seem to have the same mechanics.
2. Can a non-Orthodox country takr control of a patriarchate like the Ottomans in 1453 when they appointed their own patriarch of Constantinople?

How does the game intend to represent extraterritorial patriarchates such as Antioch and Jerusalem?
Will the hesychast controversy be portrayed in the game?
Has mount Athos got any unique flavor?
Can you give us more information about the alternatives for "Mask", "Essence", and "Person"?
Is there any flavor regarding the pentarchy?
What are "Christological debates"?

If you free a tag with (I assume) Nestorianism as its main religion, like Assyria, does it become the sole member of a Nestorian Chrch IO? How does the AI handle it?

Just added a final section with a couple of things that were missing, for those of you who came exactly at 15:00 to read it.

Is there any content around the Hesychast controversy and its outcomes - and if so, can we see it?
Also, could you change the Miaphysite churches to their official name of Oriental Orthodox and 'Orthodox' to Eastern Orthodox? Miaphysitism is a doctrinal position, not the name of any church.

I hope that some of these 'policies' could be changed
only at the Ecumenical Synode
where all the patriarchates and autocephalus churches participate.
And it should be very hard to gather all of them since it did not happen historically within the game time frame.
Also I would make it specifically impossible to 'destroy' or cancel four
Ancient Patriarchates
-
Ecumenical
,
of Alexandria
,
of Antioch
,
of Jerusalem
, since they were established by the Ecumenical Councils and survived through hard times till today.

Do the saints give any bonuses or only the one time gain you get when you canonize them? What determines how much prestige and estate satisfaction you get from canonizing someone? Is it only their stats?

How is the Christianization of Lithuania, the last major Pagan country in Europe, handled? As the head of the Orthodox church, is it possible to defy destiny and have them convert to Eastern Christianity instead, as almost happened in the OTL?

@Pavía
could you please show us the ecclesiastical territories of the Georgian Patriarchate? It should look something like this (excluding the north Caucasian parts, of course)
Thank you!
The church should be centred at
Mtskheta
, not Tbilisi.
"Armenia", led by the Zakarid dynasty, and Shaki, most likely led by Georgians, should be in the Georgian church IO. The Zakarids from
Zakare's
death on were Dyophysites, while the collateral branch of
Ivane's
descendants (the current rulers) were Orthodox since even before his death.
Additionally, the Georgian church should own buildings in
Jerusalem
,
Athos
, and
Bulgaria
, to represent the Iberian monasteries present there since the 11th century.
Finally, here are some Georgian rulers who should be sanctified in 1337:

Vakhtang I - Wikipedia

Usually there's a couple of 'wow's in the beginning of these DDs that get burned at the stake every release.

Can you give more details about how the tenets can change ? Is it only through a synod ? Are there other ways ? Also, is there an effect to being "oecunemical" or is it only a flavour name for some existing patriarchate ? Can member of an oecunemical patriarchate still impact the tenets and the synods or are they pure spectator ?
Overall the mechanism looks great I have to say.

The description of this icon talks about the monastery its in, which is kind of weird if you move the icon to another location. Does the monastery move with it..?
Cool feature, but ”throw a periphora/procession” sounds weird. Wouldn’t ”organize a periphora” sound better?
