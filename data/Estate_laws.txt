Distribution of Power determines how authority is divided among the ruler, administrative bodies, and estates. The state is a complex and fragile entity — a well-balanced power distribution ensures stability, while giving any single institution too much power risks breeding tyranny or administrative paralysis.

Cortes de Navarra
The Nobility, the Clergy, and the Burghers have formed a deliberative assembly called the
Cortes de Navarra
, which has the duty to approve laws and taxes, and to investigate legal transgressions. While all Estates debate together, each of them votes as a separate assembly. The position of each Estate is previously decided internally by the majority. In order to achieve a resolution to any issue they deliberate, all Three Estates must agree on the action. Their power allows them to dethrone and elect rulers when needed, and overall to keep the power of the monarch in check.

While religion itself is not a problem for us, the extensive rights and influence held by the  Clergy is of great concern for our state and its people.
