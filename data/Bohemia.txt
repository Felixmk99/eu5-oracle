The lands of Bohemia are in the heart of the Germanic
Holy Roman Empire
, and inhabited by Slavic people. After a long period under the Přemyslid dynasty, the current de Luxembourg rulers may drastically change matters by tightening the country's existing ties with the Empire, although King Jehan the Blind de Luxembourg is more French than German, having been educated in the royal court of Paris. Keeping both the
Nobility
and the
Commoners
satisfied under a foreign King, while navigating the political intricacies of the Holy Roman Empire, would prove a hurdle for anybody. Fortunately, Bohemia is a strong Kingdom, but will it succeed in its ambitions?
