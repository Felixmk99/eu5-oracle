Tinto Talks #89 - 19th of November 2025
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Nov 19, 2025
Hello Everyone and Welcome to another Tinto Talks, where we talk about what we are doing with Europa Universalis V.
Tomorrow we will release 1.0.7, which will include
Some fixes to levies as detailed in
https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/levy-vs-regulars-some-information-from-tinto.1876702
Further improvements to killing of privateers.
Crash fixes
We are still working with fixing issues you have reported, and making sure that as many as possible are solved every week.
Let's talk about three interesting changes for next week.
Economical Base
This is something that has gotten some negative feedback in how it's calculated, so the system really needed to be reworked.
Before, the issue was basically that the Economical Base was calculated from your Tax Base + Buy Price of your Trades. While that scaled nicely, it also made trade far less beneficial than it should be, and also made building up your tax base not always great.
For next patch instead we are now basing the Economical Base on 3 different factors.  Your tax base, your subjects tax base & your population, with it being 50% of your tax base, 10% of your subjects tax base, and 0.01 ducats for each 1,000 pops you have.
At the same time now, we will restore the trade maintenance to the intended size.
Combat Tooltips
To be brutally honest, the tooltips we had on regiments in combat were rather bad and confusing, and some things were completely hidden. Now you will see which section a regiment is in, and which section the target is in.  You will also see the chance of joining the main sections if in the reserves, and the chance of using initiative to engage.
We have also been reworking how we display the damage a regiment does as well, so that it's more clear, with the multiplier to the left, and the actual change in the damage to the right.  (yay for decimals on soldiers)
Centralization vs Decentralization
One of the meta that appeared was that centralization was always superior, so we decided to rework this Societal Value to be a distinct choice and less of a no-brainer.
We reworked subject loyalty so that a significant part of what used to be the base value is now impacted by this societal value, where if you want to have a lot of subjects, it's probably beneficial to be decentralized.
We also made it so that the diplomatic ability of rulers impacts your subjects' loyalty.
That is it for this week, but there are lots more coming every week, so stay tuned.

The economic base changes look very good so far. Any info on estates being perpetually bankrupt being fixed too? Currently also leads to certain intended demand boosts from estates never being activated.

Thank you, Johan!
So glad that the Centralization meta is being worked on.
Just to clarify, will these change come with 1.0.7 as well, or with a later patch?

Will there be any talks or feedback on the large UI mega thread regarding plans and ideas for a revamping of the UI/UX? Maybe it could work as a Tinto Talk with the community suggesting and going back and forth with other ideas, etc.

Absolutely love the constant release, is there however a reason why you don't separate more bugfixes and balance changes ? Like with a beta branch or something similar ?
Also, have you considered making decentralisation allow for cities to act as better local proximity source, at the cost of eventually more estate power in the concerned cities ?

I kind of wish the 1.0.5 levy change was just reverted for the moment, while keeping the 1.0.5 bugfixes and 1.0.7 crashfixes, and then these army balance changes were added to an opt-in branch.
This seems way too reactive a way of balancing. Core mechanics get changed massively, get bad feedback, so a change gets made, gets a day or two of testing and then another large balance change goes out? If this solution is no better than 1.0.5/6 we have to either suck up bad balance for another few days or go back to 1.0.4 and opt out of crash and bug fixes while we wait for the next fix.
Not a fan of that approach. I wish balancing changes this big were added to beta-branches we could opt-in to or otherwise held back a few more days to be thoroughly tested. The levy/regular balance was not so thoroughly broken in 1.0.4 that it needed this rushed treatment. It could have been rolled back like the trade changes while a better solution was found and tested.
Hopefully this fix works, but even if it does I really hope the release/fix process gets better in the future because 1.0.5 and its bugfixes have been rough.

Subject loyalty needs to be something based on actions, not just values. Why are my subjects loyal? What are they getting from me besides protection (which they already pay for)? They need to think like a player or else subject gameplay as a player will always suck and subjects will always be in kumbaya mode.

I think the economic base rework is bad. The economy scales  like crazy as it is. Not having at least trade profit influence it seems crazy when you can easily get 60% of your economy to be trade income.
Also i think it will feel very bad that now your profita get shrunk for something you dont have control over,: your population numbers. So having a massively populated country with a basic economy will now cripple you for no reason?
Please test it properly. Its a huge change. Dont include it in the patch for a few weeks. Test it with time

Not a bad idea re:cities. It would show the cities' self governance and the resulting benefit from letting them run their affairs, especially in sprawling empires. It would actually let the estates accumulate more money too.
Maybe a privilege that grants cities more contol as well, something like "independent town councils/town law privilege", but make it heavy on estate privilege too.

Can we expect sometime in the future to have market access over seas revisited to avoid every island needing is own market?

I wish you could make balance changes to a beta version first, and not push those changes to all players until they get further tested by the community. Making some cost 10X and rolling it back one day later is not a good practice

very happy to see trade removed from eco base scaling, as it should not have been there in the first place, and instead replaced with reasonable values. Including subjects income in eco base was also a nice touch, that, together with loyalty changes, should lower the subject spam meta.
I hope we get fixes/rework of estates spendings on low control provinces - i.e. estates should not pay 100% of expenses for provinces they only receive 5% of income from control. Either make them get full income without control malus or multiply expenses with control as well.
Basically estate expenses and inland exploration are the only two things left to fix to make the game an enjoyable full campaign experience

I doubt centralisation meta will change because of proximity cost and crown power both being so good.
