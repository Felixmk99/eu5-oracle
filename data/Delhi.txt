Country.
A series of swift and decisive conquests in the last century gave birth to our great Sultanate of Delhi. With territories under our jurisdiction spanning from from Deccan to the fertile fields of Lahore, no other civilization can match our prestigious accomplishments.
However, it has become apparent that we have overextended our authority across such a vast Sultanate; it is becoming increasingly difficult to control nowadays. Our enemies are many, and they seek to nullify our superior heritage and sophisticated culture. To the east, our subjects in Bengal have started questioning their masters, while our southern territories have long disputed our hold over them. And the Hindu countries of Southern India may further entrench their resistance to our rule, led by the rising power of Vijayanagar.

Stability. Refusing to end the situation reduces Stability by
−50
and increases the primary opponent's Share of Power by

.
If Delhi begins employing slavery and the market used by Delhi's capital trades slaves, Delhi will unlock the Ḥabashī Advisors estate privilege and will gain a character with very high abilities and the Efficient Administrator trait.

While the situation is active, if the Ḥabashī Advisors estate privilege is present there is a 5% chance each month that the country will gain another character with the same ability and trait.
