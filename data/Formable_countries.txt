Formable countries
A
formable country
is a new country identity that can be formed (or re-formed) from an existing country fulfilling certain conditions. Players can form countries of equal or higher formation tier. The AI can only form countries of higher tier. Hovering over a formable country will highlight the areas where locations must be owned to form it, and if the formable country has advancements specific to it, its tooltip will list all the new available advances.
There are three types of formable nations:
Historical - nations that existed at some point during the timeframe of the game
Plausible - nations that likely could have existed if things had changed only slightly
Ahistorical - nations that are highly unlikely to have ever formed realistically.
The formation of ahistorical nations can be disabled via the game rules.

The lands of the Mandinka have a proud history of wealth, cultural influence, and piety, exemplified by our forefather Mansa Mūsā Keita. Although this resplendence has been lost to time, if we were united once again, we could restore the commercial networks and political unity that once made the Mandinka masters of trade, and elevate our people to never-before-seen echelons of power.

Our nation is ancient, but it has not endured. Divided among competing rulers, we have one by one fallen prey to stronger enemies. The lands before the Nile Cataracts must be unified under a single rule, capable of resisting those enemies and defeating them in battle, if we are ever to rise again as a realized power in this world.

Over the centuries, the Finnish people have been ruled by foreign powers, and their lands controlled by foreign hands. But we have never lost our distinct Finnish ways nor our desire to subdue those who would oppress us for them, and our moment to break away is finally here. The time has come for the state of
Finland
to be born and take its place among the pantheon of nations!

Across the windswept expanse of the steppes, the Kazakh people roam free without a unifying ruler, leaving us vulnerable to outside attacks. But were we to finally be brought together under the command of a single leader, and to share an identity as a nation, we could turn the tide. Thus, we shall unite under one flag to rule the seas of grass as mighty

Ours is an island of many influences, a conflux of cultures that has created unique syncretic beliefs and ways of life. Although this mixture of differences is part of what makes us great, we should promote the idea of our being a unified people despite these distinctions. A unified Malagasy state under our leadership will allow our island to prosper and ensure stability — and increased power — for our people.

The history of our nation is one of rise and fall, great dynasties collapsing only to be reborn. Yet among the ebb and flow of this dynastic chaos, our culture shines like a precious jewel. We are a people of art, learning, science, and progress, the light in this region. Our nation must achieve lasting stability and grow powerful through unity, ensuring the prosperity of our people and striking fear into the hearts of our enemies.

Indonesia is a rich land, overflowing with precious resources and luxuries. Although its people are varied and diverse, many of their traditional cultural aspects are the same, mainly due to the diffusive effects of maritime trade. Were we to unite these many islands and peoples under one banner, we would be a strong contender for ultimate regional dominance.

Ever since the collapse of the Great Moravian State, the Slovak people have been ruled by foreign powers, who govern over us with little regard to our interests. But during this dark period, we have slowly but surely been growing our power, our people drawing closer together in solidarity. It is finally time to assert our sovereignty and establish a state free from foreign rule.

The division of the Circassian people into separate competing tribes must end. If we wish to grow strong and not succumb to external pressure, we must be brought together under a single powerful leader who can skillfully guide our people towards prosperity — and strike terror deep in the hearts of our enemies.

Empire stands as a symbol of divinity and imperial destiny. From the sacred city of Tenōchtitlan, our glorious leaders have succeeded in uniting large parts of Mesoamerica under one radiant Sun. Through faith, warfare, and sacrifice, our newfound empire shall reclaim its sacred purpose of ensuring that the heavens burn bright, and the gods are honored.
