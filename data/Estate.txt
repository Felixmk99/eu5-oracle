Estates
are special interest groups within a
country
. They may provide
tax
,
army levies
, and
naval levies
. Each
character
belongs to one of the estates; some
succession laws
limit their heirs to specific estates.
The name of an estate depends on the country's government, culture, and religion.
Estate stats
[

]
Every estate has 3 stats to track, except for the Crown Estate, which only tracks the Estate Power.
Estate Power
is a percentage divided among all estates that represents their political strength within government and how much influence the estate has when debating parliament issues. It depends on how many pops the estate has and what privileges the estate has been given. Every pop has a Political Power, which is decided by the social class it belongs to and determines how much they contribute to Estate Power. When an estate's power is below 25%, it provides scaling bonuses the lower is it, mainly increased maximum tax. When an estate's power is above 25%, it provides different scaling bonuses but also reduces the estate's maximum tax and increases monthly progress towards a certain
societal value
.
Estate Satisfaction
represents how happy an estate is with how the country is currently being ruled. If it is above 50%, the country gains bonuses depending on the estate, but if it is below 50%, it gives similar penalties. If it drops below 25%, the country is not able to recruit levies from that estate and if below 1% will not be taxed either. Estate satisfaction also has a direct impact on the satisfaction of its pops. The game displays both the current estate satisfaction and the
satisfaction equilibrium
, which is the value the estate satisfaction slowly drifts towards. Estates can be bribed with gold at any point to increase their estate satisfaction by 10%, but this does not increase the satisfaction equilibrium. Each country has a base satisfaction equilibrium of 30%. If their satisfaction is >50% then a die roll check against their satisfaction if they should build a good building for the country or just for them.
Estate Opinion
is the opinion each estate has towards every other country. Estates want their country to befriend countries the estate has positive opinion of and to be hostile towards countries the estate has negative opinion of. Hovering over an estate displays its 5 most liked and least liked countries, and hovering over that tooltip as well displays its 20 more liked or least liked countries. Estate opinion is affected by country opinion, as well as how much estate power the same estate has in each country.
Estate privileges
[

]
Each estate except the
Crown Estate can be granted estate privileges, which provide various bonuses and increase the estate's
Satisfaction but also increase the estate's power. Granting an estate privilege costs 5 Government Power, and revoking an estate privilege costs 4 Stability for every 1% estate
Power. Granting an estate privilege gives its estate
Satisfaction equal to 3 times the Satisfaction Equilibrium provided by it, and reduces the
Satisfaction of the other estates by half that amount. Revoking an estate privilege reduces the
Satisfaction by 3 times the Satisfaction Equilibrium provided by it and by an additional −25%. The
stability is reduced by 400 multiplied by estate relative power then affected by various modifiers. If the primary religion is
Sānjiào it will also cost 10
Righteousness.
Crown estate
[

The Crown Estate represents the power of the government that other estates do not have. This estate does not have population, and its estate power scales with the country population and the ruler's administrative ability. Instead of estate privileges, the crown estate has
reforms
.
Each percent of crown power also grants
+0.5%
Parliament base support. Unlike other estates, low estate power for the crown estate gives penalties and the estate should have as much power as possible.

Estate power calculations
[

An estate’s total
Power is determined by summing the political power generated by the pops of each location in the country, applying any
local estate power modifiers
(only for the Crown Estate
[1]
), and finally applying the
national modifiers
affecting the country as a whole (such as
Legitimacy,
Estate Privilege,
Reforms).
For each location, the game calculates political power by looking at every population type present there, multiplying the number of individuals of that pop type by the political power provided per pop of that type, and then applying the location’s total local modifiers. The national modifiers are then applied once to the final sum.
The full formula is:
EstatePower
