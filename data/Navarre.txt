Iruña (2617)
Originally founded by King Eneko Arista Íñigo around the city of Iruña as the Kingdom of Pamplona, the Kingdom of Navarre has left its glorious days behind, now being territorially limited between big neighbors that look upon its lands with ravenous greed. Born as a Basque march of the Carolingian Empire, the realm has witnessed the rise and fall of local dynasties and their replacement by French ones, which have tipped the fate of the realm inevitably towards the
Kingdom of France
.
Without open paths of expansion and laboring under so much cultural pressure, will the Kingdom of Navarre be able to resist the more powerful surrounding nations and recover its past glory?
The Kingdom of Navarre is one of the oldest Kingdoms on the Iberian Peninsula. The kingdom is the continuation of the ancient Kingdom of Pamplona centered around the Basque Country. However, the days of Navarre being one of the stronger kingdoms on the divided peninsula are behind it as
Castile
and
Aragon
have nearly completed the Reconquista.
