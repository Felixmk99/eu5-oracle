These laws encompass a broad range of matters related to navigation, shipping, trade, and maritime activities taking place on oceans, seas, and other navigable waterways. They cover areas such as maritime contracts, vessel ownership and registration, marine insurance, salvage and wrecks, liability and compensation for maritime accidents, crew rights and responsibilities, and many other aspects that pertain to maritime affairs. Maritime laws are designed to ensure safe, orderly, and fair practices in the maritime industry and resolve disputes that may arise in the context of maritime activities.

Sumptuary Law
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Clothing in Nahua society reflects our social hierarchy and marks important life events such as marriage, birth, and death. The Commoners typically wear simple cotton garments, while high-ranking elites dress in far more elaborate attire decorated with brilliant colors and priceless feathers. Warriors, by contrast, are permitted to wear only plain mantles.
The Cihuacóatl is now establishing Sumptuary Laws that will regulate how subjects dress, what they may purchase in markets, and which ornaments they may wear, all based on their rank.

Warrior Culture
Our state's survival depends on the strength of our warriors. Every male is expected to fight when called upon to do so. To strengthen this warrior culture, the Cihuacōātl is establishing laws that restrict what people may wear, own, and purchase, as well as which government positions each estate may hold, based on their battle prowess.
While these laws protect the rights of our Nobility, they primarily reward martial valor. Among Commoners, combat skill shall determine dress and other privileges. Even Nobility can only access government positions by demonstrating courage in combat.
