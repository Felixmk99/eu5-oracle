Norway has 6 estates,
Crown
,
Nobility
,
Clergy
,
Burghers
,
Commoners
and
Tribes
. Some reforms and privileges have allready been enacted at game start. The Tribes estate would disapear should the

Every 60 months you can call a
Storting
(Parliament). The player can chose where the Parliament takes place and what should be debated. Should the player chose the capital (Oslo) to host the Parliament, the country goes towards
Centralization
, if another location/town/city is chosen, the country goes towards
Decentralization
, but the chosen spot gets increased control.

Geopolitics

Norway has a population of 474k and is extremely decentralized at game start with overall low control. They don't start with any founded cities, but have 6 towns spread around. Should the player want to play a centralized campaign, they might considered waiting on centralizing the country untill after the subjects have been annexed, since being decentralized gives a bonus
Loyality of Subjects
modifer. Greenland and Orkney can be annexed pretty early in the game since they are small and have a low population.
Norn
culture is allready accepted in Norway, so concilidating Orkney and Shetland shoudln't bring many difficulties.
Icelandic
culture is in the same culture group as Norwegian, but is not a tolerated culture at game start, and the population in Greenland is not big enough to tolerate it after annexed, which could cause rebellions. Annexing Iceland is another story, without any modifers it could take 60 years to annex them. Consider enacting
Feudal Nobility
as a
Institute Government Reform
early which gives a small
Loyality of Subjects
modifer, especially if both Greenland and Orkney was annexed quickly because that gives Iceland a 2x
Annexed Subject
negative modifer opinion of Norway.
Norway has a presence in 3 markets at game start;
Oslo Market
,
Stockholm Market
and
Edinburgh Market
. The player could at a peace deal with either Sweden or Scotland force to take over their markets in order to consolidate Norway's trade. The player also gains a presence (and takes over the market) in
Garðar Market
after annexing Greenland, and
Skálholt Market
upon annexing Iceland.
Norway borders colonizable locations in Northern Scandinavia, allthough only the locations in the provinces of Nordland and Finnmark can be colonised by Norway. The rest of Scandinavia have been claimed by Sweden and Novgorod through the
Treaty of Oreshek
. Should the player wish to colonise these areas they must force Sweden and Novgorod to revoke their claims in a peace deal at the cost of some Antagonism, or conquer it from them should they allready have finnished their colonial charter in the respected provinces. It is also possible for Norway to colonise the rest of Greenland after annexing them.

]
At the start of the game Norway is a part of two IO's.
Catholic Church:
As a member
Swedish-Norwegian Union:
As a Junior Partner
Breaking free from the Union
[

edit source
]
In the early game Norway cannot declare war on Sweden due to being in the union, but it can be done once a
Union Policy
changes. Around the time when the
Black Death
breaks out (on historical), Sweden will implement the
Establish Seniority
policy under the
Foundation Laws
in the
Swedish-Norwegian Union
. Norway can also vote to enect that policy. Once the bill have been passed and the new policy have become active, Norway can create one of two types of CBs;
Union Independence Casus Belli
can be used to break free from the union, or
War for Seniority Casus Belli
can be used to take over the union. Both CB's require a spynetwork of 20 in Sweden to fabricate. Whichever CB the player uses when declaring war, the game will randomly generate a new charatcer to become the new king of Norway.
