A monarchy can only survive as long as its subjects believe in the legitimacy of their ruler. There are many ways in which rulers justify their power. As time goes on, new political philosophies will arise which explain the need for a strong government in their own ways.

Two Treatises of Government
The nature of humanity is characterized by reason and tolerance. No man is born evil. However, human nature leads our people to be selfish and act only for their own good.
The government ensures that this selfishness is resolved in civil ways. It also serves to defend the natural rights of life, health, liberty, and possession.

Calpixque System
This Nahua governance system has evolved beyond its initial structure of hereditary
tlatoani
leaders. Provinces are now administered by appointed officials: local stewards called
calpixque
, and high stewards called
huecalpixque
. These officials manage the provincial tribute system under the supervision of the
petlacalcatl
in the capital. In particularly unruly provinces, military governors known as
cuauhtlatoani
may be appointed to maintain control.

Zabt System
It is in the best interest of our state to encourage economic productivity, while simultaneously keeping a constant watch over regional economies. However, we have not always been successful in our administrative efforts, as ruling over the economic activities of so many subjects requires significant amounts of both human and material resources.
In order to solve this, we have created the
zabt
System, which establishes regular cadastral surveys to measure agricultural land, assess crop productivity, and classify land quality. Based on these surveys, standardized revenue rates are calculated and collected in cash rather than in-kind. This creates predictable, systematic taxation that ensures our state revenue reflects our actual agricultural capacity.

Prónoia System
The Prónoia system functions as a means of temporarily transferring imperial fiscal rights, such as taxes or income from various sources, to individuals or institutions. Unlike the feudal system prevalent in Europe at the time, Prónoia grants were neither hereditary nor transferable, and ultimate ownership remained with the Emperor. In exchange for these privileges, the system ultimately served the purpose for the head of state to raise an army in times of need, and entailed that the troops had to mostly cover their own expenses.

For as long as people have gathered together in societies, they have created laws to govern their actions and interactions. Legal codes are a reflection of the values and beliefs of a society, shaping everything from how people conduct business to how they treat each other. They are the very fabric that holds a society together, providing a framework for order and justice. Despite their differences, people tend to share a common goal: to create a just and fair society where everyone can live in peace and prosperity.

Traditional Law
There are a plethora of informal punitive systems developed by communities based on their customs, traditions, and values. These legal systems have been passed down orally from generation to generation and are deeply rooted in the culture and history of the community.
The strength of Traditional Law lies in its ability to reflect the unique needs and values of a particular community. It is based on a shared understanding of what is right and wrong, and is often seen as more legitimate and accessible than formal legal systems. However, it can also be limited by its insularity and lack of flexibility.

This allows for a degree of predictability and consistency in legal decisions, but can also make it difficult to adapt to changing circumstances and may lead to the entrenchment of unjust or outdated laws.

Ḥanafī Jurisprudence
The Ḥanafī Madhhab is named after Abū Ḥanīfa Al-Nu'mān ibn Thābit. The school originated in Kufa and is prominent throughout the Farsi and Turkic world, including northern India. Though textual sources in the Qur'ān and Ḥadīth are given preference, Ḥanafī followers have an inclusive view of sources and also employ analogy (Qiyās), juristic discretion (Istiḥsan), and local customs ('Urf) in their jurisprudence. Some view it as the most flexible of the schools.

Ḥanbalī followers maintain that the Qur'ān and Sunnah are the only proper sources of jurisprudence and that they should be interpreted in a literal and traditionalist sense. Though it is accepted as a valid Madhhab, very few states actively promote the Ḥanbalī school, and it was banned by the Abbasid Caliphs.
