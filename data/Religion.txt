A Religion is any system of beliefs that belongs to a
Religion Group
. Every character and pop has a Religion (and may be converted to a different one).

Each country will regard religions in one of three ways:
Primary Religion
is the official religion within a country. It gives access to different content and mechanics and pops with a different religion will slowly convert to the primary religion under the right conditions. Each country has a Religious Unity, which is the percentage of pops that follow its primary religion. Every 1% Religious Unity increases the clergy estate satisfaction equilibrium by 0.1%. The primary religion can be changed every 10 years to any religion present in the country. This costs 50
Stability and may have additional requirements depending on the Religious Conversions game rule. Changing the primary religion will also convert the ruler and various characters to the new religion.
Heretic Religions
are religions that are part of the same religion group.
Heathen Religions
are religions that are part of a different religion group.
Each country has a tolerance towards each religion type, which by default is
+1
for the primary religion,
-2.5
for heretic religions and
-5
for heathen religions. Tolerance affects the satisfaction of pops with the same religion and opinion of countries with that primary religion.
Each country has a Religious Unity, which is the percentage of pops that follow its primary religion. Every 1% Religious Unity gives the following bonuses:

Ḥanafī
The Ḥanafī Madhhab is named after Abū Ḥanīfa Al-Nu'mān ibn Thābit. The school originated in Kufa and is prominent throughout the Farsi and Turkic world, including northern India. Though textual sources in the Qur'ān and Ḥadīth are given preference, Ḥanafī followers have an inclusive view of sources and also employ analogy (Qiyās), juristic discretion (Istiḥsan), and local customs ('Urf) in their jurisprudence. Some view it as the most flexible of the schools.
