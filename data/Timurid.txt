The
Timurid Empire
was a late Medieval Turco-Mongol empire that dominated Iran starting in the late 14th century, with the conquests of
Temür Borjigin
. The empire was founded in 1370, but would begin to crumble after the death Shahrukh Mirza, the 4th head of the empire.
The Timurids do not start on the map, but are spawned by event when Temur comes of age. At the start of the game, Temür is located in Kosom, in the
Horde of Barlas
. He is the son of Taraghai Borjigin.

Strategy

The Timurids
do not exist at the start of the game
, and annex Barlas and their neighbor to the north when the event fires in January 1360. Effectively this means that nothing you do as Barlas actually matters except one thing - educating Temür. You can effectively destroy your economy to get him a high quality education and build any buildings you might want. It can be annoying to sit and do nothing for 17 years, but it is a very rewarding campaign, with the potential to launch the horde into any location it can see on the map. It is recommended that you find Temür immediately on game start, add him to your favorites tab, and marry him to a daughter as soon as he comes of age.
Something to consider when beginning your great conquest is that you do actively generate antagonism with each conquered province. This means coalition wars, which can be excellent for snowballing even further. However, you will eventually have to deal with them when you complete the situation. Pay attention to the antagonism you generate, and avoid permanently hampering yourself.
Similarly, you will inherit the economy of a horde when you settle. Do not ruin your country!
Your goal as Temur will be absolute domination of whatever your core region is. Selecting a core region will give you cores on
every province in the region
. When you have reached 100% domination of one of those regions, you will be able to shift your primary culture for free.
