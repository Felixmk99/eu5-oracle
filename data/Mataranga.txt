Initially under the overlordship of the Serbian Empire, the principality emerged following the empire's decline after the death of Stefan Dušan in 1355. Ruled by Blasius Mataranga, a member of the notable Mataranga noble family, the principality maintained de facto independence during this period, with diplomatic and trade relations with the Republic of Ragusa. It lasted until 1367, when much of its territory was absorbed by the neighboring Principality of Albania, ruled by the Thopia family, and the Principality of Muzaka, ruled by the Muzaka family.
