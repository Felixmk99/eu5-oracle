Upon the death of Philip of Taranto in 1332, there were various claims on his domains within the Angevin family. The rights of the Duchy of Durazzo (Durrës) and the Kingdom of Albania together were given to John of Gravina with a sum of 5,000 pounds of gold. After his death in 1336, his dominions in Albania passed to his son Charles, Duke of Durazzo.
During this period there were different Albanian noble families who began consolidating their power and domains. One of them was the Thopia family whose domains were in central Albania. The Serbs were pressing hard in their direction and the Albanian nobles found a natural ally in the Angevins. Alliance with Albanian leaders was also crucial to the safety of the Kingdom of Albania, especially during the 1320s and 1330s. Most prominent among these leaders were the Thopias, ruling in an area between the rivers Mat and Shkumbin, and the Muzaka family in the territory between the rivers Shkumbin and Vlorë. They saw the Angevins as protectors of their domains and made alliances. During 1336–1337 Charles had various successes against Serb forces in central Albania.
Andrea I Muzaka established a de facto independent rule over Berat, he was also formally recognized by the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos as he held the high Byzantine court title of sebastokrator. The Principality of Berat reached the peak of its power during the rule of Andrea II Muzaka who, according to the chronicle of Gjon Muzaka, defeated King Vukasin at Pelister, modern day North Macedonia, and was awarded with the title of Despot by the Emperor of Constantinople, the second highest title just below to that of Emperor. Andrea II expanded his territory to the maximum extent it would reach: from the Adriatic Sea between the Vjosa river and Devoll to the east, including Korça. In 1343 the Principality of Berat was conquered by the new Serbian Empire, but was recreated after that empire's fall in 1355. In an alliance with the Đurađ I Balšić, and the great lord of Ohrid Andrea Gropa, in 1372 Andrea Muzaka managed to also conquer Kostur from Prince Marko.
