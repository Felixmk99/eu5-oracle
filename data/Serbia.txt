Serbia encompasses fertile lowlands and plains in the north, crisscrossed by the mighty Danube and Sava rivers. In the south, the landscape transforms into rugged, forested terrain and, eventually, the towering Dinaric Alps.
Serbia emerged as a significant regional power under the Nemanjic dynasty. Founded by Stefan Nemanja in the 12th century, this royal lineage laid the foundations for a unified Serbian state, began to solidify its Christian Orthodox identity, and sought to establish ecclesiastical autonomy. This effort culminated in 1219 when the Serbian Orthodox Church gained independence.
Under the rule of Stefan 'the First-Crowned', Serbia's territorial expansion accelerated, and the acquisition of coastal regions on the Adriatic Sea secured access to maritime trade and introduced Western influences. Stefan's son, King Radoslav, promoted the country's cultural development, fostering education and art, and monasteries like Studenica and Žiča flourished, housing precious religious manuscripts and frescoes.
Despite the many recent advancements, Serbia now faces external pressures and internal divisions. The Mongol invasion in the 13th century inflicted significant damage and conflict within the ruling Nemanjic family, particularly between King Stefan II Uroš Milutin Nemanjic and his brother King Stefan Dragan Nemanjic, further weakening the state's unity. But perhaps the tide is turning, as the strong rule of King Stefan Uroš IV Dušan Nemanjic has begun, giving him the opportunity to change the tides of history.
