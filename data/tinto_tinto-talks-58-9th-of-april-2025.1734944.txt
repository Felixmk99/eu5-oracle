Tinto Talks #58 - 9th of April 2025
Thread starter

Start date

Hello, and welcome to another Tinto Talk, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about our entirely super-top-secret game with the codename Project Caesar.
Today, I will be your host instead of Johan since we will be talking about the flavour mechanics. These will be basically IOs, Situations, and Religions, and we will be talking about a bunch of them for some weeks, although from time to time Johan will come back to present some other stuff. So, let’s start without further ado with the Holy Roman Empire, the
most convoluted organization invented by mankind
only Imperial polity that existed in Western Europe for most of the game period.
In 1337, it’s a very different beast compared to previous installments in other PDX GSGs. The Great Interregnum that started in 1254 after the deaths of Frederick II and Conrad IV of the House of Hohenstaufen, and the double election of two contenders (Richard of Cornwall and Alfonso X of Castile) in 1257 led to a period of weak and diminishing Imperial Authority. In the coming decades, the Houses of Habsburg, Luxembourg, and Wittelsbach would fight for the Imperial election, making the Electorates increasingly more important.
A beautiful beast! The color code for every country:
Yellow: Emperor
Light Blue: Prince-Elector
Middle Blue: Archbishop-Elector
Dark Blue: Imperial Prelates
Light Green: Free Imperial Cities
Middle Green: Republics
Pink/Brownish: Imperial Peasant Republics
Grey: Imperial Princes
Purple Stripes: Imperial Land not owned by an HRE member
Other stripes: Land owned by an HRE member not yet incorporated as Imperial land
Here is an overview of the HRE IO panel and all the different member types that you can find by scrolling down on it:
And here is the sub-panel that show all its members:
The HRE comes with a bunch of mechanics and features, which you can easily grasp in the IO’s tooltip:
Let’s start with the most important base feature, the Imperial Authority, which is the currency used by the Holy Roman Emperor to enact Imperial Laws. There are a few sources to either add or subtract Imperial Authority:
Note: the missing +0.01 comes from value rounding which is not reflected in the tooltip.
​
Imperial Laws create different effects that impact the members of the HRE. At the start, there are only two available:
You may notice that there’s a category, ‘Fundamental Laws’, with only one policy possible, the ‘Golden Bull’. This was the single most important law approved in the HRE, becoming its base political constitution up until its dissolution after being enacted in 1356. In Project Caesar, the Emperor has a very high incentive to pass it as soon as possible, as it unlocks additional laws and actions:
When you have 35 Imperial Authority, you can try to enact it, and a Vote in the Imperial Diet will happen:
That works quite similarly to country parliaments, as you have to secure a positive vote of the different HRE members:
And this would be the situation after the law passes, with 8 new Imperial Laws available:
In general terms, most of the laws have 5 policies available, with the starting ones usually being in the middle positions of the 5. This is how it works (these are 'instructions' in the script):
#With the enactment of the Golden Bull, most HRE laws are set to the 3rd policy which has limited or no modifiers active at all
#The HRE Emperor can try to change the policy to the next adjacent one (so from 3rd tier to 4th or 2nd tier)
#The left tier is the 4th and 5th and is more in favor of benefitting the HRE as a whole
#The right tier is the 2nd and 1st and is more in favor of benefitting the HRE Emperor first and foremost
#Some laws have only 3 policies in which cases there are not pro-Emperor vs pro-Member positions
#The only law which does not follow the rule is the power_of_the_emperor_law which starts at improved_imperial_authority_policy (4) policy.
#The reason for this is to delay the unification of the HRE + there is not much design space for an even further decentralized HRE.
#As such, having 2 policies for the decentralized HRE are not really doable.
#                               LAW
# Pol 5          Pol 4          Pol 3          Pol 2          Pol 1
#   |--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|

Let’s take as example the Imperial Voting Law:
The Imperial Election is then a key feature, since it elects the Holy Roman Emperor, who then sets all the Imperial Laws, Diets, etc. Here you can see an example of how it works:
The King of Bohemia got backed by most of the Electors, and thus, became the Holy Roman Emperor after the death of Ludwig IV of Upper Bavaria.
​
This event will trigger if a different country gets its ruler elected as Emperor, as in this example:
One of the factors behind the election is the Dynastic Power, a new value that is currently only used for the HRE mechanics (although it could potentially be used for other IOs, as it’s a scriptable/moddable feature), which impacts the likelihood of a certain country from a powerful dynasty to be elected or re-elected as Emperor:
Last but not least is the Imperial Contribution. It is an amount of money and manpower that any member of the HRE may contribute to the Emperor, who can later spend it in Imperial Actions, and also defending the Empire (in theory…):
… And that’s all for today, since it’s already a very long TT! Next week, we will be taking a look at the
Catholic Religion and the Catholic Church IO
. Cheers!

Hopefully it will be feasible for the Franks to retake the Throne of
Charlemagne
Charles the Great Caroling as emperors. Definitely going to be one of my first campaigns.

If you mention the East Germanic tribes, I will appear faster than the goat-drawn chariot of Fairguneis flies across the skies above.

Looks great! I have a small wish regarding flavour in generel, though.
Say France is eclipsed and annexed by a French minor. This minor does not reform France, but occupies the same territory, and is French culture. How much France-flavour does the minor take from France?
I'm really hoping for flavour dynamism like this. Dynamic but culture/region/language/religion specific.

Very meaty TT!
1. Can Imperial Authority be gained or lost via selecting options in events / situations?
2. If your country changes Dynasty, do you lose all Dynastic Power accumulated?
3. Will the option to disband HRE have its own requirments / flavor?

Honestly maybe change payee and payer into payments to and payments from? Payee and payer don't sound very natural to me, I don't think I've ever heard them.

A beautiful mess!
Is there a mechanism for members to secede or neighboring countries to join the HRE?

How long will the HRE elections take? Same as EU4 with immediate succession, or is there a possibility for interregnums?
