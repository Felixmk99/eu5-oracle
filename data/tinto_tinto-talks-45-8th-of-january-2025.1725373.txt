Tinto Talks #45 - 8th of January 2025
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Jan 8, 2025
Welcome to another Tinto Talks! Happy Wednesday where we talk about our super-secret game with the codename Project Caesar, asking you for feedback!
Today we’ll go into the details of how terrain works in the game. To iterate from the Map-Tinto-Talks from almost a year ago, each location has three different attributes instead of a single one as previous games had. This creates more variation and allows us more granular control over game play.
Each location has a climate, a topography and a vegetation set. Sea locations do not have vegetation though.
Climate
The climate of a location impacts how well pops can live there, including how much food can be produced. It also affects the maximum winter level of a location.
Tropical
Population Capacity +50%

Continental
Population Capacity +50%
Free Capacity Attracts Pops
Max Winter is Normal
Continental represents areas with cold winters.
Arctic
Population Capacity -55%
Development Growth -25%
Life Expectancy -5
Max Winter is Severe
Arctic represents areas with very cold winters.
Vegetation

Desert
Can have Sandstorms
Movement Cost for Armies +10%
RGO Build time +50%
Road Build time +100%
Development Growth -10%
Food Production -33%
Population Capacity +10k
Deserts are barren landscapes with little precipitation and almost no potential for plant or animal life.
Sparse
Road Build time -10%
Population Capacity +25k
Sparse represent large flat areas of land with few or no trees.
Grasslands
Food Production +10%
Population Capacity 50k
Grasslands represent terrain dominated by grass with little or no trees or shrubs.
Farmland
Movement Cost for Armies +10%
Road Build time +10%
Development Growth +10%
Population Capacity +100k
RGO Maximum Size +10%
Food Production +33%
Farmland represents anthropogenic terrain, devoted to crops and/or extensive pastures.
Woods
Movement Cost for Armies +25%
Attacker Diceroll in Battle -1
Maximum Frontage in Battle -2
Road Build time +25%
Population Capacity +50k
Development Growth -20%

Maximum Frontage in Battle -3
Road Build time +50%
RGO Build time +33%
Population Capacity +25k
Development Growth -25%
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Sea
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Land
Forest represents terrain with dense vegetation.
Jungle
Movement Cost for Armies +100%

Maximum Frontage in Battle -4
Road Build time +200%
RGO Build time +50%
Population Capacity +50k
Development Growth -50%
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Sea
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Land
A jungle represents terrain with dense forest and tangled vegetation that makes doing anything on the land difficult.
Topography
Topography represents the roughness and elevation of the land within a location. Flatter Topography is generally better for growing Towns and Cities while rougher Topography is easier to defend.
These first ones are land related topographies.
Flatland
No special attributes
Flatland represents terrain that does not have any major topographic variation, so there are no impediments for army movement or building development.
Mountains
Movement Cost for Armies +100%
Attacker Diceroll in Battle -2
Movement is Blocked in Winter
Maximum Frontage in Battle -4
Road Build time +200%
RGO Build time +100%
Population Capacity -80%
Development Growth -70%
Food Production -20%
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Sea
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Land
Mountain terrain has high altitude and also steep slopes with relatively few and narrow flat areas, so it is more difficult for armies to cross and fight in it, and also more difficult to develop.
Hills
Movement Cost for Armies +50%
Attacker Diceroll in Battle -1
Maximum Frontage in Battle -3
Road Build time +50%
RGO Build time +25%
Development Growth -30%
Food Production -10%
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Sea
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Land
A terrain with hills has variations in the topography, but the slopes are not as steep nor as high as those of mountains, so the penalties are also not as bad.
Plateau
Movement Cost for Armies +25%
Attacker Diceroll in Battle -1
Maximum Frontage in Battle -1
Road Build time +50%
RGO Build time +25%
Development Growth -25%
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Sea
They represent relatively flat areas situated at high altitude, so they have some penalties compared to flatlands due to their elevation.
Wetlands
Movement Cost for Armies +50%
Attacker Diceroll in Battle -1
Maximum Frontage in Battle -3
Road Build time +75%
RGO Build time +25%
Development Growth -30%
Food Production -10%
Wetlands are terrain that is partially flooded, generally due to being near a river, lake, or coast.
The following are the naval ones.
Ocean
Naval Attrition +1%
This is the open seas between the continents, where only the best of ships can travel.
Deep Ocean
Naval Attrition +2%
This is the open seas between the continents, where only the best of ships can travel, in the furthest areas from any coast.
Coastal Ocean
No special attributes
This is the open seas between the continents, where only the best of ships can travel, but in the areas closer to the coast.
Inland Sea
Can Freeze over during winter
Inland seas represent the land-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean or the Baltic.
Narrows
Can Freeze over during winter
Movement Cost for Navies +20%
Attacker Diceroll in Battle -1
Maximum Frontage in Battle -2
Blocks Vision from Adjacent Sea
Narrows are areas of sea with proximity of coast on many sides, like straits or the sea inside archipelagos, where there is not much space for movement.
Lakes, Salt Pans and Atolls exists, but are just graphical variants of  Coastal Oceans, even if lakes could freeze over during winter.
Stay tuned, as next week we’ll delve into the wonderful world of military objectives.

Wow, this looks really amazing!
I just have a suggestion on the
possible and highly requested
vegetation change mechanic
.
If
deforestation
is implemented, you should also implement
reforestation
mechanic in the locations, that lost significant part of their population (at least due to the Black Death (UPDATE – and Native Americans catastrophe)).
According to the scientists,
the Black Death caused significant reforestation in Europe
in the following ~100 years.
Here is a France example from
Mather et al. (1999)
:
Here is a table with some calculated forest cover data in Europe from
Kaplan et al. (2009)
:
Of course, that should be
limited only to relevant regions/climates
. Not expected in tundra or deserts.
And thank you for your dedication!
UPDATE
.
There will be no dynamic vegetation, confirmed by Johan in the comments.

You mean, you guys werent adding the terrain and vegetation and climate just for the love of the map-making art?
Shame. Damn shame. ( ￣︿￣)
Also, I'll say. You need a pretty good ship that can go into deep ocean. With only 2% drowning, no less.

With the amount of detail being put into Project Caesar I was wondering if there have been any stability/performance tests for multiplayer at this point, or has the game not yet reached a stage where a multiplayer test game could be done to check for performance issues?

1. So the cost of the road stays the same, only the time changes?
2. Is there a map mode to check battle conditions (like defender bonuses), similar to the "simple terrain" mode in EU4?
I know the 3D map can handle this, but I’m worried it might not completely avoid confusion about where exactly a river counts or where the hills are.
If we have to watch out for forests, hills, and rivers all at once, it might mean switching between two modes while moving armies.

Cold Arid
icon with snowflakes
(
e.g
. in Spain, Africa, Crimea)
may look really confusing
to the broad public, even though the naming is scientifically correct.
Crimea
and
Costa del Sol
are hardly associated with the terms '
cold
' or '
snow
' in terms of climate.
I suggest:
Rename
cold arid
into just
arid
,
semi-arid
or
cool arid
and somehow get rid of the snowflakes in the icon
Rename
your
arid
into
hot arid
or
just
hot
(
optional
)
This will be far less confusing for the players who do not know about Koppen classification.

Are salt pans traversable under any circumstances? Can they dry out during the hot season and allow armies to walk over them?

Reposting my comment from the Japan Tinto Maps
How do you guys plan to represent Japan’s snow country, the climate is subtropical and temperate generally, but due to its geography it’s gets some of the heaviest snowfalls in the world. Can you just give it a special modifier that gives worse winters despite the climate?
Snow country (Japan) - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org
Japan is the world's snowiest country, 51% covered by snow | | Muslim Tourist Information Centre
Surprisingly, Japan is the snowiest country in the world.According to the US-based AccuWeather survey, Japanese cities are among the top 3 in the world for annual snowfall in cities with over 100,000
www.groovyjapan.com
The heavy snowfalls of Japan's snow country are caused by moisture-laden clouds bumping up against the mountains along the backbone of Honshū and releasing their moisture under the influence of
westerly winds
blowing off the continent or down from Siberia. As a result, the region includes some of the world's snowiest spots at the same latitudes, many localities are also frequently visited by
avalanches
.
Frequently
snow
is so deep in some places that buildings have a special entrance on their second story; people must remove snow from their roofs to prevent its weight from crushing their homes, and special care is taken to protect trees from the snow's weight. In some towns, people used to tunnel paths to one another's homes, and streets were lined with covered sidewalks to ensure that people could get around. Today in areas where temperatures are high enough to make it practical, many roads are equipped with sprinklers using warm ground water to keep them passable by melting the snow.
The most recent record snows were brought by the blizzards of December 2005–February 2006, when well over 3 m (4.5 m in one part of
Aomori Prefecture
) of snow accumulated in many rural areas, and anywhere from 46 cm (
Tottori
) to nearly 1.5 m (
Aomori
) piled up even in several major cities.

It says that deserts have sandstorms; I assume this impacts armies/combat in some way? Are there any variants for sea tiles to have storms as well?

Back in the first map dev post about the netherlands you mentioned not being sure whether or not terrain change would be possible in engine. Any change in that? Any hope for polders?

I have a feeling that, in the end game, the extent of these penalties will create severe disparities in development between neighboring locations within the same country. For instance, I might expect the boundaries between continental and Arctic in Sweden, or between Mediterranean and cold arid in Spain, to create pretty extreme differences between neighboring locations as the game goes on.
is there any mechanism to “blend” or even out neighboring population/development, so neighboring locations don’t become too different?
EDIT:
I'm fine with topographical/vegetation differences, but in regards to climate, this is what I mean:
At the boundaries between climatic regions, we flip from bonuses to severe penalties. In reality, there are additional climatic types that the tinto team has lumped together for simplicity. But because Paradox has lumped these climatic types together, we lose the "mixed condition" border regions.
(here, paradox has lumped Cfc (subpolar oceanic), Dfc (subarctic), and ET (tundra) into the same "Arctic" category, while in reality, there may only be small differences between subpolar oceanic and oceanic)
400 years into the game, I suspect this will create really severe disparities in development that wouldn't actually happen between locations that are literally right next to eachother.
What I am wondering is whether there is any mechanism to help low development locations "catch up" to high development locations that they directly neighbor. This might help to even out this otherwise unrealistic long-term differences

Also what exactly makes the Mediterranean climate the best vs say subtropical, isn’t it generally drier?
