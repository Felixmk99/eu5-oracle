Scotland is once again in peril.
A mere generation ago, our national hero, King Robert de Bruce, freed us from the
English
rule, alongside the famous martyr, William Wallace.
Now his successor — the bairn King David II de Bruce — lies exiled in
France
as our loyal nobility continues their struggle against
Balliol
, the English king's lackey state that falsely claims the Scots crown.
Though the people of our Kingdom are currently united in our cause, this is not guaranteed to last. Embedded in our kingdom are deep cultural and societal divisions, especially between the wealthy English-speaking Scots burghs of the lowlands and the Highland people who dwell in the inland hills.
Long ago, Roman invaders built a wall against us, so fearsome was the Scots reputation. Perhaps it is time to reinvigorate that ancient ferocity...
The
Kingdom of Scotland
is a monarchy in northern Britain, ruling over its vassals
Ross
and
Moray
. Recently freed from
English
domination, the realm once again faces an existential threat, beginning the game amid the Second War of Scottish Independence. With its rightful king displaced, a rival claimant of the
Balliol
dynasty—backed by English power—contests the Scottish throne.
