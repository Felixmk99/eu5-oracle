Tinto Talks #52 - 26th of Feburary 2025
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Feb 26, 2025
Hello and Welcome to another Tinto Talks, the Happy Wednesday where we spill all the secrets about our upcoming game with the codename Project Caesar.
In a game where we simulate hundreds of millions of people, not all calamities that they get exposed to involve Warfare or Diseases. Today we will talk about how Mother Nature does her best trying to reduce the population regularly.
Little Ice Age
As the widest definition of the Little Ice Age encompasses almost the entire timespan of our game, we decided to go with the Maunder Minimum, which happened between 1645 and 1715, being the colder phase of the period. We simulate the Little Ice Age with a Situation that will affect the northern half of the Northern Hemisphere, making winters last longer.
During the Little Ice Age, food production in the affected areas is lowered, and events and other mechanics are happening which will make the experience a challenging mid to late-game phase.
Who will survive?
Weather
We also have a rather in-depth weather system, where we simulate storms and similar phenomena moving across the planet. We currently have two categories of weather systems, the weather front, and the cyclone. We have also included in the weather fronts the monsoons, which have the particularity of going in one direction (Africa to India) from February to June, and in the other direction (Himalayas to the Indian Ocean) from October to December.
Ireland might suff
er some weather fronts during the year, yeah…
Not all weather systems that spawn are the same strength, and their strength can change as they move across the map. The strength of the weather system directly impacts the benefits and penalties they give to the locations.
Fronts are usually wide weather patterns bringing rain from the oceans into lands. This has some negative impacts on armies and navies, but it provides a large food production boost.
This was a huge rainstorm..
Cyclones, or Hurricanes as they are known in the Northern Hemisphere, are a more narrow weather system, which causes a lot of damage due to high wind speeds.
At least no buildings damaged? Or????
In deserts with cold arid or arid climate, there will not be sometimes beneficial rains though when a weather system passes through, but instead you will get sandstorms.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
In any location with severe winter, where a front passes through, there will be snow instead of heavy rain.
Didn’t stop Carl Gustaf Armfeldt trying to move his army..
Volcanos
There are locations which contain volcanos that are not entirely dormant. At any point, any one of them can erupt, spewing out long streams of lava and an enormous cloud of ash that leaves a path of destruction in its wake, causing huge devastation to the location they are present in.
It will ruin RGO’s, destroy buildings, kill a lot of people, and reduce prosperity dramatically.  Afterwards, there is a small boost to food production due to volcanic soil for a few decades.
Can be helpful longterm yes?
Earthquakes
A large part of the world is prone to earthquakes. While we do have some famous historical earthquakes likely to happen, we also have a small chance that any area with an earthquake risk can get one.
Similar to a Volcano it will destroy buildings and kill people, but earthquakes will usually not affect just a single location, but many adjacent ones as well.
Sadly there are some locations that are in the awkward position of most being in an earthquake zone, and having a volcano.
Not the best place for a city?
Next week we’ll be talking about how mercenaries work in Project Caesar.

Really hope that natural disasters in “PC” will provide some challenge for the player, but at the same time will not make the game feel unfair/unplayable for some nations (Yellow River Flood and Yangtze River Flood EU4 Events flashbacks).

Awesome! Little Ice Age! I feel like I've seen people ask for this 100x, so cool to see it being implemented!

Is there going to be a weather mechanic for drought?

@Johan
a bit unrelated but what happens to units on mountains while they are wasteland during winter? Since there are countries with only mountain locations

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

Are volcanic eruptions random or scripted from real life?Do all volcanoes erupt at the same rate?If not do they erupt based on their real life activity?

Weather fronts, even if they only bring rain, should have the possibility of causing some death by flooding if you lack adecuate infraestructure to fight the waters. See Valencia a few months ago for what i mean.

No special 1 year announcement.
Would you look at the time its a quarter past nothing ever happens.
Any guess about TT #52 ? (anniversary)
The map visuals ? The public announce on YouTube? The announce with the map visuals? Just another topic to be hyped about?  Thanks again for all these Tinto content that slowly reveals a game I'm hyped about

Also shouldn't "Volcanic soil" be a more permanent modifier and just just after an eruption?

Do earthquakes have the potential to cause giant fires as well, or is that already represented by the destruction they deal out already?
1855 Edo earthquake - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org
"The
1855 Edo earthquake
(安政江戸地震,
Ansei Edo Jishin
) was the third
Ansei Great Earthquake
, which occurred during the late-
Edo period
.
[3]
It occurred after the
1854 Nankai earthquake
, which took place about a year prior. The earthquake occurred at 22:00 local time on 11 November. It had an
epicenter
close to
Edo
(now Tokyo), causing considerable damage in the
Kantō region
from the shaking and subsequent fires, with a death toll of 7,000–10,000 people and destroyed around 14,000 buildings.
[4]
[2]
The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the
surface wave magnitude scale
and reached a maximum intensity of XI (
Extreme
) on the
Mercalli intensity scale
.
[1]
[5]
The earthquake triggered a minor
tsunami
."

Wow, aweomse. Any chance we can get the earthquake and volcano maps?
And I assume the map at the top shows weather systems?
