Ancient Hispania witnessed the advances and retreats of both Christianity and Islam peoples time and time again, and these competing bids for power have continued into the present. At the present moment, the tides of fate favor the former, with the latter group barely maintaining their diminished holdings. However, the ultimate outcome is not easily guessed, as while the Islam nations are united, the Christianity realms are plagued by division and infighting.
Will these chaotic times end with the final expulsion of the Islam forces from Iberia, or will the Islam people recover the lost lands of Al-'Andalus?
The
Nasrid Emirate of Granada
is a monarchy in southern Iberia, bordered by
Castile
to the north and
Morocco
across the Strait of Gibraltar. A rump state of
Al-Andalus
, Granada is the last independent Islamic polity on the Iberian Peninsula and the final heir to Andalusi culture. Despite facing immense political and military challenges at the start of the game, the White Phoenix retains the potential to reclaim Iberia and restore Al-Andalus.
