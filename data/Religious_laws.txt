Tax Farming
Effectively collecting property taxes is the backbone of our national economy. Despite what the Commoners might advocate for, this revenue is vital for funding various projects, endeavors, and campaigns. As such, the accumulation of revenue and the general administration thereof should be entrusted to methodical Iqṭā' holders.

Originally established to combat the heresy of Catharism, the Inquisition has become the Catholicism Church's primary tool for investigating and prosecuting heresy. Via specialized ecclesiastical courts, trained inquisitors investigate potential heretics, extract confessions of religious or moral transgression, and impose punishments ranging from penance to execution, for violating Catholic mores.
