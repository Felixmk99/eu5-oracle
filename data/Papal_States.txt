Avignon (2398)
Since its creation by the hand of Saint Peter himself, the Catholic Church has guided humanity to salvation through the ages under the leadership of the bishop of Rome, the Pope. Starting with the Donation of Pepin, the blessed Papal States came into being with the intent of both governing and aiding the faithful.
However, the last few decades have been a constant struggle. The death of Pope Bonifatius VIII Gaetani Aquila forced the court to relocate to the exclave of Avignon, where we fell under the influence of King Philippe IV the Fair Capet. As well, our holdings in Italy have become dominated by quarreling noble families.
What should the vicar of Christ do to resolve this exceptional situation? Will he fully become a puppet of the
Kingdom of France
, and allow the temporal to rule over the spiritual? Or will he break free and rise to the position at the top of Creation, which God intended for the Church?
The Papal States is a medium-sized country on the Italian peninsula that begins the game as the leader of the
Guelphs international organization, within the
Guelphs and Ghibellines
situation. They control twenty
locations
, nine of which are urban, giving them the potential for a strong economy. However, this strength is significantly reduced by the lack of proximity caused by their exclave
capital
in Avignon. They also start out with a vassal,
Faenza
