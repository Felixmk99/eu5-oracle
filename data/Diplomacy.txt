The diplomacy menu
Every country has a number of diplomats, which are required for diplomatic actions or spy networks. The maximum number of diplomats a country can have at a time is limited but can be increased by certain advances or societal values.

with: favors section and brief description of trust and antagonism.
Each country has an opinion, trust, favors and antagonism towards every other country
[1]
:
Opinion determines whether a country will be hostile or not and ranges from
+200
to
−200
.
Favors can be spent to ask the other country to do something. If favors are already unbalanced, refusing will cause a loss of trust and reduce diplomatic reputation for 24 months.

Trust is necessary for forging lasting agreements and ranges from
+100
to
−100
.
Every country has a

Antagonism
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Antagonism reduces a country's
Opinion by
−4
and at higher levels makes a country less inclined in diplomacy and causes it to become hostile in indirect ways. Antagonistic actions can cause an antagonism 'bomb' in a location that affects the countries near it to varying degrees depending on how much they care about that location and about the antagonizing country. Antagonism 'bomb' effects will generally dissipate with time. Antagonism is affected by the following:
+50%
Country is the victim of the antagonistic action
+50%
Target location has the same overlord
+40%
Target location has the same culture
+35%
Target location has the same religion
+25%
Target location has the same dialect
+20%
Target location has the same language
+20%
Target location has the same culture group
+5%
Target location has the same government
+5%
Target location has the same language family
+4%
Per development in the target location
−5%
Target location has a different government type
−35%
Target location has a different religion group
−80%
Country is a subject of the aggressor
−4%
Per Diplomatic Reputation point
−1%
Per Legislative Efficiency point
Antagonism is reduced by the distance between the targeted location and the third party's borders
If a country has more than
50
Antagonism,
coalitions
can be created against it.
Diplomatic capacity
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Diplomatic capacity dictates how many relations a country can have with another country. Diplomatic capacity costs are determined by the difference in population and rank between the countries as well as their opinion of each other. Trust will decrease diplomatic capacity costs. Membership in some international organizations costs diplomatic capacity as well.
Countries that go over their diplomatic capacity will suffer the following penalties for each point:
+20%
Antagonism Received
−2
Diplomatic Reputation
−25%
Crown Power
−0.1
Monthly Prestige
−25
Loyalty of Subjects
Sources of Diplomatic capacity:
Base Value for Every Country: +1.00
Duchy Country Rank: +1.00
Kingdom Country Rank: +2.00
Empire Country Rank: +3.00
Diplomatic Traditions (Government Reform): +1.00 at 100% implementation
Rule through Dynastic Ties (Law): +1.00
Expanded Archives (Age I Advance): +20.00%
Formalized Relations (Age III Advance): +1.00
Threaded Politics (Age V Advance): +1.00
Diplomatic Spending: +50% at 100% spending
Ruler's Diplomatic Ability: +1% per point
Power projection
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Each country has a power projection, which allows it to build trade offices, colonies, slave centers, missions, or other specific buildings in locations owned by countries with less power projection. The greater the difference, the quicker colonial charters can take control over the other country's locations. Each point of power projection also reduces the percentage of pops of primary religion and culture required to complete colonization by 0.5%.
Great powers
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Each country has a great power score, which measures how powerful it is. Subjects transfer a certain percentage of their great power score to their overlord, depending on their subject type.
Great power score depends on the following: population, income, advances, stability, prestige, government power, markets, trade routes, navy, allies, army, discipline, war exhaustion.
The 9 countries with the most great power score are considered great powers and gain the ability to intervene in wars, enforce peace, threaten war, and receive the following bonuses:
Rank
Power projection
Monthly prestige
Monthly diplomats

Hegemony
[

edit source
]
After the Age of Discovery starts, the great power that meets certain requirements for 120 months will become a Hegemon. Hegemons unlock a unique cabinet action, a unique diplomatic interaction, and a unique bonus as long as they maintain the requirements to be Hegemon. Hovering over a Hegemon type will list the current requirements to become the Hegemon and which great powers are closest to becoming Hegemon. Being a Hegemon gives the following effects, which stack if the country is Hegemon in multiple categories:

Rivals
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Countries can declare their hostility towards other countries by declaring them as rivals. Countries have some additional hostile actions against their rivals, like the ability to fabricate a Casus Belli and the option to intervene in their Wars. A Rival Country will not accept friendly Treaties like Alliances, but Countries with common rivals will have an easier time signing Treaties between them. Rivalry is not reciprocal, meaning that it is not necessary nor automatic for a country to rival back the ones that have rivaled it. A country that has declared another as its Rival is known as its Enemy. Only countries with similar Great Power Score and negative opinion can be declared Rivals.
Declaring a country a rival reduces opinion between the two countries by
−100
. This stacks if both countries declare each other rivals. If two countries have the same rival they gain
+50
Opinion with each other. This does not stack if they share multiple rivals.
Declaring a country a rival is free, but removing it as rival costs
25
stability.
Each country can have a number of rivals, depending on its country rank. Having fewer rivals gives the following penalties for every missing rival:
+0.1
Monthly progress to Conciliatory
+10%
Antagonism received
−10%
Counterespionage
−10%
Spy network construction
Spy networks
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Countries can build spy networks inside other countries via the diplomacy menu. Each spy network has a progress that goes from 0 to 100. Once the network has at least 25 progress, there is a chance each month that a spy will be discovered. Once a spy network is formed, it gains progress at a rate of
+1
per month and reduces Monthly Diplomats by
−0.1
. Maintaining a spy network can be stopped at any point, which will cause it to decay by
−1
each month. Both the speed at which a spy network gains progress and the chance for spy discovery are affected by the target country's Counterespionage as well as the difference between the Cultural Influence of the country's primary culture and the Cultural Tradition of the targeted country's primary culture.
Each point of progress speeds up sieges against the target's locations by
+0.2%
and reduces the Antagonism impact towards the target by
−0.1%
.
Spy networks allow a country to create a casus belli on the target at the cost of 20 spy network progress. Spy networks also allow a country to perform covert actions. Only one covert action can be performed each month. Subjects of another country cannot have spy networks and covert actions will use the spy network in their overlord country instead.
