Majapahit
is a Javanese culture nation that begins as one of the
Hindu
nations. Majapahit starts the game in a Queen regency that leads into the reign of Hayam Wuruk Rajasa, a historical figure noted as being the ruler of the empire at the time of its greatest power.
Majapahit starts in an excellent situation to play a tall, colonial, trading game. Its islands are very defensible, and the money you have at the start of the game makes it easy to ward off the Black Death and put yourself in a leading position. However, the death of King Hayam Wuruk Rajasa leads into a disaster of the same name, followed immediately by the Decline of Majapahit, both of which require a high stability and crown power to get out of - something that can take a long time if you don't choose your events carefully through the process.
