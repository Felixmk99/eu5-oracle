Japan starts with the
Nanbokuchō Jidai
situation in 1337. This situation splits the clans into two sides either joining the Jimyōin Court or the Daikakuji Court. Each clan can either chose to support their historical side, defect to the opposing side, or support neither side.
The
Sengoku Jidai
situation will begin after 1400 when several requirements are met. This situation gives individual clans the opportunity to defect from the Shogun and become a land based country with the Daimyō government.
Shinto

Honor
to obtain other bonuses.
