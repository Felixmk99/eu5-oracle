This page is planned to be
automatically generated
from the game files. It should not be edited directly.
Instead, please suggest changes or improvements on the
talk page
.
This page can trivially be autogenerated. Therefore, instead of manually adding countries, please make suggestions for what content would be useful on this page. Only listing the flags and rank is not really useful, because that could also be put on a generic list of all countries.
