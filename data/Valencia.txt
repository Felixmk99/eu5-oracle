Capital location
Valencia (2704)
Valencia is a releasable kingdom on the Iberian peninsula encompassing the province of the same name. Valencia was considered a jewel of the Mediterranean during the eleventh century and was briefly the capital of legendary warlord El Cid Compeador. Although those days are gone and Valencia is a dominion of the Crown of
Aragon
, nothing says an enterprising player can’t lead the reborn kingdom to dominance over the western Mediterranean.
