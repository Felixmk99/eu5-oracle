Tinto Talks #80 - 10th of September 2025
Thread starter
Roger Corominas
Start date
Sep 10, 2025
Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will talk about two more Situations that may happen in the Mid Game: the
Golden Age of Piracy
and the
Little Ice Age
! Let’s start, without further ado:
Golden Age of Piracy
​
Although there have always been Pirates! at sea, with this situation, we aim to portray its Golden Age, especially in the Caribbean Sea, around the second half of the 17th century. As such, the situation may trigger at the start of the Age of Absolutism (1637), and may be active for as long as 50 years.
​
This is the situation panel:
​
At the top left, you have a shortcut to change your Piracy Law:
​
While at the top right, you have the action to send Privateers. There are multiple ways to be able to unlock and hire Privateers, prior to the situation:
Two generic advances, from the Age of Renaissance and the Age of Reformation
Three unique advances, for Maghrebi countries during Age of Tradition, Novgorod in Age of Renaissance, and the Frisian countries in Age of Discovery
Two policies in the Piracy Law, the State Policy generic one, and the Sea Beggars unique one (available to the Netherlands)
The Galley Lords reform, available to countries in the Celtic culture group
The Pirate Brethren reform - which is the default Major reform for Pirate countries
​
Let’s now move into the Situation actions. You can follow two different courses of action: sponsoring Pirates and combating them. The latter is the boring one, requesting other countries to cease their pirating:
​
The other option is to sponsor Piracy, as you can establish a Pirate subject nation:
​
…Which, obviously, opens up the option to continue playing as the newly established Pirate nation! This is an entirely different Type of Country, something we hadn’t yet talked about: a Navy Based Country:
​
With its unique Reforms, Succession Law,etc.:
​
Besides all the regular mechanic gameplay for them, this will also open new actions for them in the situation:
​
There are also historical events to spawn 6 different historical Pirate nations: New Providence, Libertalia, Salé, Tétouan, Port Royal, and Tortuga - which you can obviously play with, if they spawn in your country:
​
At the end of the situation, a variable will calculate if the Pirates won it (with a reward for the King of Pirates), or lost it:
​
Little Ice Age
​
A foreword on the Little Ice Age, before we start with it. Technically speaking, this climatic period is considered to start some time around the 14th or 15th centuries, following the Medieval Climate Optimum. What we have represented in the game is the Maunder Minimum, a very cold period that started around 1650 and lasted for some decades (differently, depending on the region). We considered that this would fit well with our game, so the LIA is a global situation happening during the Age of Absolutism, from 1645 to 1715.
​
The start of the situation will add a Harsh Winter modifier to all locations impacted by it, which will reduce their Food Capacity and Production. Thus, this is a very mechanical Situation, in which managing your Food is the key action to do, to avoid losing valuable pops:
​
Which, besides normal gameplay mechanics, you can also do from the Situation panel:
​
But, besides the mechanical behaviour of the situation, there will be narrative events happening during it, as well:
​
Until, finally, the situation ends:
​
… And much more, but that’s all for today! Now I have a message from
@Pavía
, about the schedule for the next couple of weeks.
Hi there! I have a bit of sad news for you: we will be skipping most forum posts for a couple of weeks (except Dev Diaries, which are handled by CM team), as we have a bank holiday this Friday, then next week we have to attend a Paradox Staff Conference in Stockholm (before anyone asks: we won’t be an entire week there, but we want to use as many work days as possible of that week to focus on what’s important now for us, polishing the game), and the following Monday we have another bank holiday. This means that we will be back to the regular schedule on
Wednesday, 24th
. However, from there until the release of the game, we’ll have the regular weekly posts once again. This is how it will look, then:
Thursday 11th -> DD #3 -
Trade and Economy
Thursday 18th -> DD #4 -
Discovery
Wednesday 24th ->
@Johan
will be back to Tinto Talks, to talk about
Multiplayer
!
And also remember, you can
Pre-Purchase Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

I knew executing Gold Roger was a bad idea.
Edit:
Also, can any pirate run, or do you need one of the 9 pieces of 8?

Since it is about certain ages, I have to ask you to
implement a bit more dynamic windows for the ages like in EU4
.
Knowing the exact Age duration 1.1.1637 – 1.1.1737 in every run feels artificial and predictable and is a definitely
step backwards vs. EU4
.
Spoiler:
Benefits of variable Ages
The spread of advances is different every time.
The duration of situations is different every time.
Adds a lot to the replayability.
Here is the relevant thread and people seem to highly agree on the issue. Please, take note of that or at least could you explain why not:
Kotyk-durkotyk said:
Having hardcoded spawn dates like the
1st of January, 1342
and then the
1st of January, 1
x
37
(with
x
=
4, 5, 6, 7
) for every Age just feels wrong – too artificial.
A flexible window (±10–20 years) based on the game dynamics (like in EU4) would make the transitions feel less gamey and would be more interesting and unpredictable.

Thanks!
Otherwise it looks interesting. Definitely a step towards more interesting late game.

Are there any pirate tags at the start of the game?
The victual brothers would be a fun tag in the Baltic.

Will the tinto talk about MP actually lead to feedback being considered and implemented? Would love for this to have some of the best MP offered.

They are not present at start, but there's an event that can spawn them pretty early on.

Can pirates spawn outside the timeframe of the situation? Can navy based countries settle anytime or is it available to them only during the situation?

anything about piracy in the baltic?

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

Is there any chance earlier Pirate Republics that formed historically might show up, like the
Victual Brothers in Gotland, Visby
?

There can be some spawned outside the situation through events, but they can only decide to abandon piracy during the situation.

Best of luck for that final rush before the game releases !
As usual with situation like the golden age of piracy, the end reward seems too temporary for something that long lasting. maybe not a "free bonus because gotta grab them all", but I'd say the reward should be the fact the situation keeps going (with eventually some effects for the pirates as long as it keeps going ?). And it needs active successful non-pirates nations involvment to make the situation end.
The two flags symbols is the pirates republic legitimity, or is it something else ?
