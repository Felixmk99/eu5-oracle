Deriving from the core concept of concrete reality (

Having made its appearance in ancient debates, it resurfaced as an important proponent in determining the nature of the Holy Trinity, where it describes its three proponents as sharing one divine essence.

The Gǎitǔguīliú System
The native Chieftains in remote prefectures, also known as Tǔsī, are hereditary rulers of local minorities. These leaders might seem useful now and then due to their ties with the locals, but they have frequently proven to be a long-term risk to regional stability. By slowly replacing them with officials appointed by the central government, maintaining tranquillity on a regional level will become easier.

Policy
Confucianism
Confucianism is a philosophy developed from the teachings of Confucius, or Kǒng Fūzǐ, emphasizing social harmony and the righteousness of government institutions.
Daoism
Daoism is a philosophy emphasizing living in harmony with the
Dào
, the living force of the universe, and the concept of
Wúwéi
, or 'action with no-action'.
Pure Land Buddhism
Pure Land Buddhism is one of the most followed schools of East Asian Buddhism, and is centered around the idea of achieving rebirth in a Buddha's Pure Land. The most common Pure Land is that of the Buddha Amitābha, and the most important teachings are the
Three Pure Land Sutras
. The principal form of practice is the mindfulness of the Buddha, via repeating the name of the Buddha as a form of recitation.
Lotus School
The Lotus School, so named to honor the importance of the
Lotus Sutra
, is one of the earliest Buddhist schools developed in China. It emphasizes the doctrine of the
One Vehicle
, promoting an inclusive view and understanding of all Buddhist teachings.
Dharma School
Called
Wéishí
or
Fǎxiàng
in China, and
Hossō
in Japan, the Dharma School tradition emerged from India and has had a profound influence on Eastern Buddhism. It focuses on idealism and the idea that reality is only consciousness, and emphasizes the practices of yoga and meditation.
Flower Garland School
Taking its name from the
Flower Garland Sutra
, and called
Huáyán
in China,
Kegon
in Japan, and
Hwaeom
in Korea, Flower Garland School is one of the main Buddhist traditions developed in China. It emphasizes the doctrine of interpenetration, wherein all things exist in a state of mutual dependence and are simultaneously present within each other.
Meditation School
The Meditation School was founded by Bodhidharma, according to tradition, and is called
Chán
in China,
Zen
in Japan,
Seon
in Korea and
Thiền
in Vietnam. Though meditation is a general practice in Buddhism, this school emphasizes its use as a means of achieving enlightenment, usually in a sitting position, but also while performing physical activities like martial arts.
Mantra School
The Mantra School, called
Zhēnyán
in China and
Shingon
in Japan, focuses on the esoteric practices of Vajrayāna, especially those called the 'three mysteries': mudra, mantra, and mandala. Its practices have been very influential in the development of many other schools of Buddhism.
Shugendō
Emerging as a syncretism of mixed practices from Buddhism, Shintō, and Onmyōdō, Shugendō aims for the achievement of supernatural powers via religious training in the mountains. Mountain worship and trekking are the main focuses of this sect, as well as other esoteric practices and rituals.
Azhaliism
When Tantric Buddhist practices came into Yúnnán, they mixed with traditions of Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese origin, creating a hybrdized faith. As such, Azhaliism has emerged as a relatively localized tradition, similar yet distinct from the other, bigger schools.
Musok
Centered around the worship of deities and ancestral spirits, Musok beliefs have been present in Korea since before the introduction of Buddhism. Even after that, its beliefs, practices, and rituals continue to be an important part of the region's culture.
Mūlasarvāstivāda
One of the earliest Buddhist schools in India, the traditions of Mūlasarvāstivāda have almost disappeared from most currents of Buddhism, only surviving in Tibetan Buddhism and in Indonesia. There, the first current to arrive was Hīnayāna, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda, together with Tantric Practices, became prominent during the Śrīvijaya Empire.
Mahāvihāra
A center of Buddhist scholarship since the religion first arrived on the island, Sailan has developed its own tradition of Theravāda Buddhism. As such, it has been influential in the development and spread of Buddhism in other neighboring areas, especially since the start of the decline of Buddhism in mainland India.
Burmese Buddhism
Although strongly influenced by the Mahāvihāra Buddhism of Sailan, other forms of Buddhism have spread around Burma. Eastern Buddhism and Theravāda traditions, as well as Hinduism and also some remnants of pre-Buddhism beliefs, have all blended together, giving rise to a particular flavor of Theravāda. While very similar to the one practiced in Sailan, this sect also incorporates many elements of Eastern Buddhism and other esoteric traditions.
Lankavong
Many different forms of Buddhism have been present in the lands of Thai people for ages, from Chinese-influenced Eastern Buddhism to earlier Indian Buddhist traditions. Eventually, the Theravāda tradition from Sailan became the main school of thought, but influence from earlier traditions and even from Thai folk beliefs still remain.
Khmer Buddhism
The first form of Buddhism that entered the Khmer area was Eastern Buddhism, with strong Tantric influence, which replaced the Hindu beliefs already present in the region. Over time, Theravāda replaced Eastern Buddhism, and a great shift was made towards monastic life.
Tantric Practices

Nichiren
Founded by the Buddhist monk Nichiren, most of its doctrine comes from the
Lotus Sutra
, but opposes any form of deviation from mainstream teachings, including esoteric practices and rituals. It dictates that one's actions and their consequences, not only meditation, affect the achievement of enlightenment.
Jōdo Shinshū
A school of Pure Land Buddhism, it was founded by Shinran, a monk originally from the Tendai school. He became disillusioned and went to study the traditions of Pure Land Buddhism, eventually founding a new branch. Focusing on
Nenbutsu
, the recitation of the name of the Buddha, the expression
Namu Amida Butsu
has almost become synonymous with this school, used as a way of showing gratitude to the Buddha Amida.
Nyingma School
The oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism, it contains unique teachings not seen in any other form of Buddhism. It considers
Dzogchen
, 'Great Perfection', the most direct path to enlightenment, prescribing this method above those advocated by other schools. However, it has been criticized by rival schools for lacking connection to later Indian tantric practices, as its texts derive from the first introduction of Buddhism into Tibet.
Kadam School
Stressing compassion, study, and discipline, it attempts to create a comprehensive and systematic Mahāyāna Buddhist path to achieving enlightenment. It also has the objective of integrating laypeople into Buddhist daily life, while reserving tantric practices for advanced initiates.
Kagyu School
The Kagyu School focuses on the
Mahāmudrā
, the 'Great Seal', which is the symbol of attaining knowledge or awareness of the intrinsic emptiness of reality. Although the school itself has diverged into multiple sub-schools, all with their own small differences of interpretation and practices, all recognize the Mahāmudrā.
Sakya School
Originating in the Sakya Monastery, it focuses on
Lamdré
, a system of meditation with the maxim that the result of the practice is already intrinsically contained within the path. These teachings are contained in the tantra of
Hevajra
, and the school contains multiple tantric practices.
Jonang School
The main practice of the Jonang School is the Kālacakra Tantra, and the school is a defender of the Shentong philosophy. In it, it holds that physical reality is empty of inherent existence, but in contrast ultimate reality — or Buddha-nature — is not. Buddha-nature is filled with its own innumerable awakened qualities.

Found the Swiss Republic
The principles and methods of the Swiss Confederation are well received as every Canton enjoys having their voices heard. Yet, the decentralized nature of the confederation will always endanger the safety and security of the Swiss people. It is time to unify the Confederation into a singular state while maintaining the Republic.
