For centuries, the great Kingdom of Hungary has defended this bastion of Catholicism from the pagans and heathens that threaten beyond. Recent rebellions amongst the
Nobility put this duty in danger, but thanks to the iron hand of King Anjou Károly, the disgruntled Nobility have been reined in, and the Hungarian faith has been renewed and reinforced.
However, the future of Hungary is not to dwell in peace, as already new trouble is brewing in the southeast that will challenge the strength of the
Regnum Marianum
.
What fate awaits the Kingdom of Hungary? Will it fall to the enemies of the righteous? Or will it stand proud before the onslaught of those who seek its demise?

Hungary is a
Hungarian
culture nation that begins as one of the
Catholic
kingdoms of Europe in 1337. Rural and undeveloped, it possesses only one city at the start of the game in Buda. It possesses several silver and gold mines in Slovakia and Transylvania which the player is advised to develop first. These should be retained as rural settlements to maintain the +100% RGO size bonus. The player should build roads and raise the control value for these provinces to maximize their income.
A Hungary player should focus on increasing control and a gradual expansion of urbanization and literacy. The player can develop towns down the Danube River from Buda to maximize the proximity bonus from the capital.
Hungary consists of the large, fertile Pannonian Basin, represented as farmlands and plains provinces. This makes central Hungary an excellent candidate for long-term population growth and urbanization.
To Hungary’s west is the Holy Roman Empire, to the north Poland, to the east the steppe, and to the south the Balkans. The Carpathians are a natural boundary offering some security for the south, east, and north. Expansion into the Balkans would be its natural course of development, however due to the geography of regions like Bosnia developing control there may cost more than the benefit it confers, thus creating vassals or custom vassals may be preferable.
Hungary begins with direct control over part of Croatia, while the rest of it exists in a personal union with Hungary, visible on the international organizations list at the bottom of the screen.
As a
Monarchy
the Hungarians can only marry with states of a similar rank, its marriage prospects are often limited and its early dynasties may face extinction. However, this can bring benefits as within a few rulers the country may gain a Polish Piast or Austrian Habsburg ruler. As Hungary is strong enough to take seniority of its personal unions, this can result in a substantial expansion of its early power.
Hungary’s one danger at the start of the game is Bohemia, which is the Holy Roman Emperor. Security or good relations with Bohemia frees the Hungarian player to focus on internal development or creating vassal states in the Balkans.
