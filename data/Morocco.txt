The Maghreb has witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties and one powerful Sultanate after another, from the Idrisids to the Almoravids to the Almohads. But this era of instability and uncertainty finally ended under the Marinid dynasty and the rule of Sultan Abu al-Hasan 'Ali ibn Uthman Marinid. Through a careful balance of military might and diplomatic acumen, we have at last secured firm control within our borders.
Now our ambitions turn eastward, where we seek to challenge the dominance of the Zayyanid of
Tlemcen
. And, to the north, we hold a strategic foothold across the Straight of Gibraltar, from Al-Ǧazīraḧ al-Khaḍrā' to Ḥiṣn al-Rundaḧ, where we stand in solidarity with our brothers in faith of
Granada
in a common effort against the Christian rulers of Iberia. Our way forward will not be easy, but we have the power and determination to face whatever obstacles we must overcome.
Morocco is a Maghrebi kingdom in northern Africa that begins the game at war with
Tlemcen
. Although it is the strongest economic and military power in the Maghreb, it is bordered to the north by
Castile
, which can quickly become a threat to the unprepared. At the start of the game, Morocco has
Tafilalt
as a loyal vassal and
Tunis
as an ally.

The below is
one of many
player suggested strategies for
Morocco
. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players.
With a large population, a winning war, and a loyal ally, Morocco starts the game in a strong position and has ample opportunity for growth. Still, they must act quickly to prepare for aggression from Castille, their primary threat. Castille will spend the early years going after Granada and Portugal (and possibly Aragon, if they aren't allied), but Morocco is next in line.
The Atlas mountain range makes it harder to establish control inland (to be continued)
