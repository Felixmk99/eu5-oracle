Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will talk about another very impactful early-game situation: the
Hundred Years’ War
!
Historically, the war started when, in May 1337, Philip VI confiscated the Duchy of Aquitaine from Edward III of England, for the reason of breaching his obligations as a vassal, which was responded to by Edward III claiming the throne of France by the rights of his mother, Isabella of France - the situation was way more complicated than this, so let’s leave the historical events here.
In our game, a couple of months after the start of the game (so, in June 1337), this event will trigger to France:
While this is the English point of view:
If the historical options are followed (which is set to always happen to AI countries), this will happen:
And it will also trigger the situation:
The starting situation of the Hundred Years’ War, with the French and English subjects. You can notice the striped vassals, which mean that these are disloyal subjects.
​
As you see, each contender has its own set of objectives:
You can also see that there’s a Strength comparison:
Note: Numbers are a matter of balance, so please consider them WIP.
​
With the situation and claims in place, it’s just a matter of time before one of the sides declares war on the other:
Something interesting is that each war is considered a ‘phase’ of the situation, so until it ends, any war between France and England will be considered ‘the 1st Phase’, ‘the 2nd Phase’, and so on:
The Situation panel will also refresh when the war starts, so you can quickly check there everything related to it:
Let’s talk now about the actions. There’s a common action that any of the sides can do, if the war has lasted for longer than 4 years, that requests the Pope to enforce a white peace among the contenders:
The most important are those related to the French subjects; the objective for France will be to rein them in and have them contribute to the war effort in the conflict phases, while for England, it will be about convincing them to abandon the French king in the peace phases:
The French subjects have their own gameplay and actions, related to their relationship with the French sovereign, and if they stay loyal to them, or not:
So, at the end of the day, one of the contenders will probably be strong enough to defeat the other. In the case of France, it’s straightforward: No more independent English presence in the continent. In the case of England, beside pure conquest, the ‘Claim of Throne of France’ peace goal requests:
England (or their subjects) must control more than 15% of the ownable locations in the French Region
England must control the capital of France
The cost of this treaty also depends on 2 factors:
A base cost
A fluctuating cost based entirely on the relative strength between the two countries. So, a stronger England would inevitably make this peace treaty option somewhat cheaper.
And that’s it on the mechanical part of the situation; but there are also a bunch of events, both random and historical, that are dependent on it:
And that’s all for today! We will come back on Friday, as we will talk in

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

I'd say the 2 options on the initial events (Robert d'Artois refuge granted) should have a bit of an impact on your nobility estates. Presumably they'd see the state as quite impotent and therefore gain a fair bit of influence should you let him flee as easily. (and for England, I'd say surrendering a noble should anger your nobility estate, while protecting him should make them quite happy)

Can England gain the support of the disloyal French vassals somehow, e.g. Burgundy?

Can you say no to the Papal delegates and continue the war (for a cost, obviously), or will it end the current phase in a white peace no matter what?

In case of a definitive victory, does France get anything more than kicking the English out? Like an opportunity to turn the tables and vassalize the English for real?

the french victory condition seem to have a loc issue where they should say "England is a subject (or below) of France". I hope the situation can trigger even if Robert d'Artois is given back / not asked based on any future "outrageous ask" / if England decide they CAN finally press claim. I'd say maybe for as long as the claim has a sort of "dynastic validity" and the age of discovery hasn't started ?

Imagine being 2 years into a conflict and calling it "1st Phase of the Hundred Years War". One might accuse someone of a slight bout of pessimism.
How likely is it these conflicts actually last multiple generations / anywhere near hundred years? Let's say for uninfluenced AI playthroughs?

This should be an option in game/campaign settings. By default make AI countries always follow historical choices, but allow players to change this for a more random and dynamic campaign.

I wonder how difficult it would be to install Jeanne on the French throne.
Would be funny.

This new "reading" mechanic sounds kinda op tbh. I hope paradox will nerf it before release.
Please keep politics to the Balkans feedback thread.
