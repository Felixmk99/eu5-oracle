Tinto Talks #16 - 12th of June 2024
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Jun 12, 2024
Welcome to another Tinto Talks, you know, the happy Wednesday, where we talk about the top secret and very much unannounced game we refer to as Project Caesar.  Today we’ll talk about another rather new, and more or less, unique system.
The Cabinet is one of the core functionalities in the game, covering areas which in previous games have been handled by envoys or mana, or may not have scaled nicely. The Cabinet in Project Caesar is a core part of many aspects of the game.
Last week we talked about characters, and we inferred roles like generals, admirals, rulers and regents. We also mentioned two roles we were not ready to talk about as well. Being in a cabinet, while being a good use of a character is NOT one of those roles, so you still have two other things to look forward to regarding characters.
Can you trust Sir Robert???
The size of your cabinet varies depending on several factors, the most important though, is how advanced your country is. At the start of the game, most countries will have a cabinet size of two, while every age will add at least one. Some government reforms or laws may also grant a bigger cabinet size, for some other drawbacks.
Who you pick for your cabinet matters as well, as each cabinet member from an estate gives +10% power to that estate. And it may not always be ideal to have a cabinet member of the wrong religion or bad culture, no matter how great they are. One example, includes the fact that the Pope might be upset if you employ an heretic as a Catholic ruler.
There are currently 45 different actions that can be assigned to a cabinet position, and more are added as the game develops. Some of these are always available, some require more advances, and some are unique that only a few have access to. Each action belongs to one of three categories, administrative, diplomatic or military, which determines which attribute is used for it.
Some actions impact the entire country, and some impact a province.
Increasing control in a single province may be good, but it's but a single province…
How efficient is a cabinet action then?  The relevant attribute from the ruler and the cabinet member has a big impact, but your societal values, laws, reforms and even some estate privileges can affect it.  Not to mention your crown power.
If you want people to leave Stockholm, winter is not enough.
Speaking of migration, next week we will talk more in detail about how the pops function when it comes to migration, growth, how they change, and what they need.

Short but sweet, any chance we could see one or two of these more exclusive cabinet actions?

Think 8-10 is the max size we aim for.
