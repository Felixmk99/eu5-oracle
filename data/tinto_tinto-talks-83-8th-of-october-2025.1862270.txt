Tinto Talks #83 - 8th of October 2025
Thread starter
Pavía
Start date
Oct 8, 2025
Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will be talking about the
Revolution
! This is the most relevant mechanic for the Late Game, giving its name to the last age, the Age of Revolutions! Let’s take a look at it without ado:
The Revolution in EU5 is a disaster that may happen to a settled country that is a Great Power, that has embraced the Enlightenment institution, with an average Literacy higher than 50%, and whose Peasant estate satisfaction is low, or whose Peasant or Burgher estates are taxed heavily. The size of the Revolution will depend on factors such as Stability, Absolutism, Literacy, Discontent, etc.
Note: Please note that I'm triggering all this content from console in a 1337 game, which is why we have the 1337 characters, and also why some stuff may break after triggering it.
​
A follow-up event will allow you to either continue playing with your current regime, or to become the Revolutionary country in the subsequent civil war:
I think so...
If you continue playing as the Revolutionaries, you'll have to fight and win the civil war to succeed; while if you keep playing as the regular country, you'll have this disaster ongoing:
If the Revolutionaries win, you’ll consolidate as a Revolutionary State, while still being a Great Power, it will lead to a Situation:
I'll let the event tooltip speak for itself:
The Great Power that triggers the Revolution will be its Herald, but if more countries become revolutionary, the strongest one will be/become the Revolutionary Target, giving it a Bonus:
This is the Situation, which is called the 'People's Uprising':
While the situation is active, countries will experience events that will shift society. You can either attempt to snuff out Revolutionary characters from the court through the "Institute Governmental Purges" action, or (once you are Revolutionary) spread and fund similarly-minded rebels in foreign countries through the "Spread Revolutionary Sentiment" action.
​
Monarchies can fight Revolutionaries through the
"Crush the Revolution"
CB or the
"War Against the [Revolutionary Country]"
event, which rallies allied monarchies to join the fight. If the Revolutionary target is at peace, the Monarchy that received the
"War Against the [Revolutionary Country]"
event will start a new war. Alternatively, if the Revolutionary target is already defending against another monarchy using the same CB, the Monarchy country that receives this event and their allies will join the existing war instead of triggering a new one.
Note; It is over for France, Andorra has joined the war!
Revolutionary countries may also experience a unique disaster, 'Revolutionary Chaos'. This disaster may occur in a Revolutionary country whose Stability and Republican values have eroded significantly.
​
Among many, one of the features of this disaster is the rise of ambitious characters, with great skills, almost Napoleon-esque...
As well as Robespierre:
Note: Every country that is NOT France will have a slim chance to spawn characters inspired by Napoleon, Robespierre, etc, during this Disaster.
​
And that’s all for today! And, from my end, it will be my last Tinto Talks up until release - although I still some some more pending Tinto Flavour posts!
Next Wednesday,
@Evife
, our UI/UX Coordinator, will talk about the
Onboarding Systems
of the game. But before that, tomorrow we’ll have a new Dev Diary, about
Diplomacy and Influencer
; and on Friday, we’ll have a Tinto Talks about
Austria
.
And also remember, you can
Pre-Purchase Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

This new "reading" mechanic sounds kinda op tbh. I hope paradox will nerf it before release.
Please keep politics to the Balkans feedback thread.

If you split off from as a nation like in the event here do you keep all the advances you've researched and various things like reforms you've unlocked?

“Note: Every country that is NOT France will have a slim chance to spawn characters inspired by Napoleon, Robespierre, etc, during this Disaster“
Why does Napoleon appear only for France?
Considering Timur is not just for Barlas, I think it makes more sense for Napoleon to not be unique as he was a Corsican born.
Whoever owns Corsica should get the Napoleon chracter as he was born there and Corsica isnt part of the French culture anyways
If you dont agree it is fine, then maybe Timur should be unique to Barlas as well and we should get chracters inspired by Timur for other Chagatai tags similar to Napoleon, if historical chracter design are meant to be rigid like Napoleon
Edit: Here is proof of Timur not being unique to Barlas my refute answer is not visible as this post

I would think that "Maximum war exhaustion: -5.00" would be a bad thing? Doesn't it mean that the country need 5 less war exhaustion to unconditionally surrender or am I misunderstanding? If that's the case shouldn't it instead be "Maximum war exhaustion: +5.00"?

What will be the government form after a won revolution? Becuase in France, at the start it was a constitutional monarchy, which later on spiraled into le grand terreur, which made it a full republic.

Looking forward to the Onboarding Systems talk, I think it's going to be
really
important for new players/casuals/people who haven't been obsessively following every post

I always thought Napoleon might be small but this potratit is over all of my imaginations. :-D  Is this some kind of easter-egg from developers? Or pure rivalry between Sweden-Spain PU against France?

If you dont change tag, yes. So, in the given case, a Revolutionary France would keep all advances and unlocked content from France.

1. I think that you should switch off all the hats for later ages for 3D characters
2. Is this probability distribution visible in-game or is this just for the Tinto Talks?

1. Napoleon is a historical character, and we are restrictive regarding which countries they spawned from.
2. Timur starts as a character for Barlas, it doesn't spawn...?

Great dev diary! Is Napoleon's stats as a character console generated or will always be 100 100 100? Not that I disagree just out of curiosity.
