Milano (3116)
The politics of the Italian Peninsula are a double-edged sword. Foes and friends, allies and rivals... all are but identities, put on and taken off as easily as a gilded mask, and Milan is no different. Centered around the strong urban center of Milano, we seek to project our strength on our newly conquered territories around us, whilst also protecting ourselves against traitors to the east and west. Internally, the rise of autonomous city-states will likely cause issues for our administration and the preservation of our sovereignty. In short, threats surround us like daggers in the night.
Despite the dangers, however, the Milanese position in this hostile environment is quite advantageous. We stand to gain an inconceivable amount of glory and prestige, should we succeed in quelling both internal and external dangers, provided we have a strong and united leadership to guide us.
Milan begins as a county at the start of the game in 1337. It is a form of republic dominated by the Visconti family, which retains the ability to form royal marriages. The state is only recently formed and most of its provinces outside of Milan require integration. Soon after starting the game, the country will be called into an event based conflict of it, Florence, and Venice feuding with Verona.
Milan possesses a gold mine to its north on the border with Switzerland, though it starts without control. Building roads to it will connect it with the capital. Expanding it, the gold province should be left as a rural settlement by the player for the 100% RGO size bonus.
To Milan’s west and south are many small powers that offer the opportunity for expansion. Without casus belli, the Milan player should wait for parliaments to create claims, allowing them to declare war without facing severe stability penalties. The player should scan the alliances of its neighbors to find the best target to attack before parliament convenes.
