Tinto Talks #75 - 6th of August 2025
Thread starter

Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will take a look at the
Black Death
situation. It will be slightly different from others, as I will present it in more detail than other Situation-related Talks, almost being an AAR. So, let's start it without further ado.
It is Anno Domini 1346, and some news arrives in Poland:
You might notice a new feature in the Situation alert tooltip - it is a
Hint
, a system that we now have in EU5, to help and guide the players with different mechanics and features. If we click on it, we'll get to the following on the right side of the screen:
The characters that appear at the top of the Hint are actual in-game members of your Cabinet, not pre-scripted. Gosciwuj has some concerns about the Black Death, apparently.
​
As you see, Hints try to give an explanation of what's going on, and also some potentially useful Recommended Actions to follow - actions that are up to the players to follow, or not, of course, as they have other priorities!
So, this new Black Death plague has appeared in a certain place called Dardeling. If you click in the Situation alert, and therefore you open the Situation panel, you'll get to know where the place is, and how the Black Death progresses:
Dardeling is the place where the plague started - could be worse, right?
Some months, maybe a year, since the plague started. It's getting closer...
​
After some time, the Black Death may end up reaching your country:
The Black Death has arrived in Poland! And while we're busy fighting the Teutonic Order in a war!
​
When the Black Death arrives, a variety of options will be available to the players - let's take an in-depth look at all of them:
Given my current situation - in a war with the Teutonic Order, and in the middle of a unique Polish disaster called 'Rise of the Szlachta':
We'll talk about the unique Polish content in a future Tinto Flavour, as usual!
​
I don't really want to get reduced satisfaction with my Estates... So the only action that I'm going to take for the moment is to 'Procure Remedies', to actually raise their support:
While the Situation is active, random events may pop up:
I've decided to do what any sensible ruler in the middle of a war would do - tax the Burghers and get money for the war chest!
I'd say it's the moment for austerity and piousness!
​
Some months more into the game, and the Black Death keeps spreading:
The ongoing war is still more important!
​
Some more events:
Gosciwuj was right - no Hint could save him!
On our side story, we've been able to peace out the Teutons, so now we can focus our efforts on managing the Black Death:
Peace in our time! The province of Chelmno is now once again part of our country! Poland stronk!
​
Focusing on the war has taken its toll, though:
Oops, too much time spent painting the map!
​
We use some of the money that we had hoarded plus what we took from the Teutons in the peace deal to build some hospitals:
More events:
And a couple of years since it reached our country (we are now in January 1350), no more locations in our country are affected by the Black Death, but it has taken a big death toll...
The plague will ravage the world for some more time to come, but at least it's over in our country, which will now have to face new challenges
And that’s all for today! We will come back on
Friday
, as we will talk in
Tinto Flavour
about the
Mamluks
!
And also remember, you can
wishlist Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

Georgia should be hit by the plague several times, but no later than 1366, according to the
"Description of the Kingdom of Georgia"
compiled by
Vakhushti
in the 18th century.
"ამ წელს მოკვდა ათაბაგი ყვარყვარე და უბოძა ბაგრატ მეფემ ათა-ბაგობა მის ძეს – ბექას, რომელიც იყო თავიდან მანდატურთუხუცესი. შემდეგ ბაგრატ მეფე მოვიდა თბილისს. როცა იხილეს მეფის სიმამაცე და მომჭირნეობა, დამშვიდდა ქვეყანა მისი შიშით და აღარავინ იპოვე-ბოდა მავნებელი, შენდებოდა და მრავლდებოდა ქვეყანა.
მაგრამ ასეთი მშვიდობიანობის დროს გაჩნდა შავი ჭირი, ძლიერი სიკვდილიანობა და ხოცვა. დაიხოცა ურიცხვი სულიერი და მოკვდა ბაგრატ მეფის ცოლი, დედოფალი ელენე და დატოვა ძენი – გიორგი და დავით, ქორონიკონსა 1366-ს, ქართულით – 54-ს (1312+54=1366)
, ამის შემდეგ კვლავ დაბნელდა მზე, ქორონიკონსა 1372-ს, ქართულით – 60-ს (1312+60=1372). მზის ასეთი დაბნელება მოასწავებდა საქართველოზე [მოსულ] ბოროტებას, რომელიც ქვემოთ ითქმება."

"In this year,
Atabag Qvarqvare
died and
King Bagrat
gave the
Atabagate
to his son -
Beka
, who was originally the
Mandaturtukhutsesi
. Then King Bagrat came to Tbilisi. When they saw the king's courage and prudence, the country calmed down in respect for him, and no one was found to be unruly, the country was being developed and multiplied.
But during such peace, a black plague, a terrible pestilence appeared. Countless souls died and King Bagrat's wife,
Queen Helena
, died and left sons -
Giorgi
and David, in the year 1366 of the
Chronicon
, in
Georgian
- 54 (1312+54 = 1366)
, after which the sun again darkened, in the year 1372, in Georgian - 60 (1312+60=1372). Such an eclipse of the sun would foretell the evil [coming] to Georgia, which will be mentioned below."

The historian
Emil Avdaliani
contends that the impact of the plague on Georgia would've been less significant than in other European countries:
"As stated, Caffa had close trade relations with the Mediterranean world, which conditioned the fast spread of the disease. However, it is also believed that because of Caffa’s commercial contacts with the Georgian world, namely Sebastopolis (modern Sokhumi), the Black Death also entered Georgia.
Indeed, it is recorded that the spread of infection took place during the reign of David IX (1346-1360), confirmed by a note dated 1348 in which ‘great death’ (most likely ‘Black Death’) is mentioned.
According to Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti Batonishvili, the pandemic endured long after the reign of David IX. It is also reported that the epidemic was so widespread during Bagrat V (1360-1393) that even the queen died, along with many others. The infection was recurrent, accelerating and abating its spread over the following centuries.
According to existent sources, the impact of the Black Death on the European mainland was more profound than in the South Caucasus.
A geographically closed off Georgia in the 14th century seems to have fared relatively well in comparison with the commercially interconnected Europe, where obliteration of nearly 1/3 of the population (some think about as much as ½ of the entire populace) took place."

Crap. I guess its social distancing time again.
Luckily, I play PDX games, so I'm already used to not being around people.

Hello, can you tell us the number of locations on the Iberian Peninsula compared to France? The Iberian Peninsula is larger than continental France, so the number should be similar or even greater on the Iberian Peninsula side.

Will the Black Death sweep across the entire Old World as it originally did, or will it primarily be confined to Europe?

I don't know how I should feel about it, since you haven't addressed the elephant in the room: the unhistorical spread of the plague into Asia, specifically India, China, and Japan.
Any word on that would be much appreciated.

An issue has been raised that the Black Death is not punishing enough in the game.
Could this be because, at the start, almost all your pops are 'unemployed, so losing half of them doesn’t feel like much of a setback?
What if countries started with much higher RGO levels and more buildings to employ more pops — and then the Black Death would destroy those as well? Then you would feel what you lose – decimated not only pops, but taxes, profits as well.
Thanks!

The hint system will be really useful for new players to not get completely overwhelmed by this game. Good Job on those

Any updates on the cold, arid climate in the middle of the Iberian Peninsula?
Another thing is that Madrid is too badly situated to become a good city since it has no farmland, has a cold, arid climate, and is a plateau. From what you showed us, have you changed anything on this point?

But.. but... I don't want to be bitten. Now that I made it into the game, I'll take my complimentary key as rightful compensation for my pain.

Are there mechanisms to stop the plague transmitting across overland borders all that quickly? Pretty much every country was infected from its ports, rather than from it overland borders - if it had ports. It sometimes took years for the plague to transmit over underpopulated land such as through the steppes. Russia got the plague a full five years after most of continental Europe, and Moscow was one of the last European capitals to be infected, despite its relative nearness to the Golden Horde. I've heard this explained as either an existing migration ban between the Russian principalities and the Golden Horde, the effects of the sparsely populated steppe, or some combination of the two. Is there a mechanism to reflect one of these and make it fairly likely that Moscow will only be infected late?
I see there are some events to represent the religious scapegoating and persecutions at the time. Will these cause persecuted minorities to flee to more tolerant states? (Historically one of many reasons so many Jews moved to Poland)
Are there enough buildings and employed pops at the time of the plague's appearance to make it as economically devastating when it culls that workforce and tax population? It seemed from earlier gameplay reveals that the loss of pops didn't hurt economies all that much in practice despite how it devastated them in real life, though that was just an impression and might have had more to do with the lack of balance in the trade system at the time.
Has the lack of urbanization in the Golden Horde been fixed? The plague was one of the contributors to their decline, so it'd be a shame not to have cities to decline.

So is there like one Meta  that we will always take to get though the plague best?
I dont recognize how diferent nations will require different choices for best outcome.

It's semi-dynamic, so it will depend a bit on each game. For instance, in my current game, the country that got impacted the most was Delhi:
By the way, there are a couple of game rules about it that you can tweak; these are the default values:

One of the recurring points in feedback from the YouTubers who got to play an early build of EU5 not long ago was that the Black Death didn’t feel impactful long term. You took a financial hit in the short term from trade collapsing, but since so much wealth generation is tied to building employment and the vast majority of the population in the early game is subsistence farming peasant deadweight, losing a third of your population had virtually no economic impact since those buildings would be repopulated within a few short years.
Is the team aware of this, and do they consider it a problem that needs to be (or has since been) solved? Namely, how to make the annihilation of even “deadweight” population a painful loss that will be felt for generations.

Since the last time that was shown, we've addressed the resistance to the disease in several regions, of which China is the most important. The higher the resistance, the less time and impact a disease has in our game.
On top of that, please take into account that numbers are a matter of constant rebalance - and the Black Death is probably the situation that has received more balance changes since it was first implemented in the game, since it's probably the most impactful.

In fact, the Black Death came to Ruthenia, Kyiv from Europe in 1350s because the Ruthenian/Steppe border was prohibited to cross and almost empty.
Will you try to simulate it somehow? This is probably not something essential, though.
