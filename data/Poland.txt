Historically, Poland was united under Mieszko I Piast, with Polish statehood considered to have begun in 966. In 1138 Poland was divided into five principalities by Bolesław III to prevent infighting among his sons and in hopes that they would work together. Instead, Poland remained vulnerable and disunited for nearly two centuries. In 1337, a largely reunited but significantly reduced Poland is under the rule of Kazimierz III. Poland begins with six subjects:
Sieradz
,
Łęczyca
,
Płock
,
Rawa
,
Czersk
, and
Inowrocław
. It also begins the game in an alliance with
Lithuania
and
Hungary
, in a truce with
Bohemia
, the
Teutonic Order
, and their subjects, and embargoing
Austria
. Due to the alliance between the two nations, Poland will be brought into Lithuania's war against the Teutonic Order and Bohemia.
