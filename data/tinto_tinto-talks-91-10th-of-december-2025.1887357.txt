Tinto Talks #91 - 10th of December 2025
Thread starter

Start date

Hello Everyone!
We are currently testing an update for the 1.0.10 open beta that we aim to have out this week, so that we can iron out 1.0.10 before the Christmas break!
As Christmas ends, after Reyes Magos, we will be back working, and while we don't want to rule out any small hotfix in January, our goal is that 1.0.10 is the last of the Lepanto updates, as we are working on the 1.1 Rossbach for February afterwards.
What are we doing in this update? Well, let's take a look.
Most important first!
Rome is now a tier 5 formable, so Byzantium can form it.
Gamebalance
We have been looking at some major complaints here around, and the following are being tried.
Cavalry now takes 25% less damage instead of 50% less damage.
Levies are now 10% stronger in Age of Absolutism and Age of Revolutions.
Occupation now changes maritime presence to benefit the occupier instead.  It used to benefit the owner of the location even when fully occupied.
Lowering the infection rate of Malaria in the Regions of Maghreb, Egypt and South Africa to 5% its previous rate.
Some important bugfixes that have been addressed recently.
Slave Raiding from Privateering now works.  This might not be popular in the Med, but..
The 'Block Building in Our Territory' works the right way around, it used to be checked opposite.
You will no longer get the “Colony Failed” when you have subjects in the same province. This was rather annoying as locations flip to your colonial nation subjects.
Some minor UI fixes.
Integration breakdowns for Provinces now calculate correctly.  It used to add values that were supposed to multiply in the tooltip.
Fixed flanking damage being inverted in tooltips, confusing many, including myself.
Other annoyances..
Subjects will no longer transfer occupation to overlord if they are the war leaders.
Oh, and the AI? Well
We are hoping that the AI changes we are testing now will reduce the bordergore and make the AI behave better.
War Declaration AI
Fixed an issue where AI would not declare war because of not wanting to spend stability even when the war would cost 0 stability to declare.
AI is now less likely to attack neighbors of far away exclaved land
Peace AI
AI will now further delay signing peace deals when they have a longlasting siege worth a lot of warscore
Fixed an issue where enemy alliance occupation percentage wasn't being calculated correctly causing AI to not peace out
Fixed an issue where AI would make peace deals in a way that split the conceding country into disconnected unreachable pieces by reviving a dead nation
Fixed an issue where AI was allowed to take exclaved land in peace deal
AI will now only annex countries if their respective capitals is within conquering distance
AI will no longer add highly situational peace treaties like food access or fleet basing rights into every peace deal when possible
Military AI
Fixed an issue where AI armies would get stuck in a cycle trying to reinforce an imminent battle
Fixed  an issue where AI armies could get stuck waiting for transports that where being trapped behind a blockade
Fixed an issue where AI would sometimes think they didn't have enough men to siege a fort due to checking combat power instead of raw number of men
Fixed an issue where AI would sometimes not merge their small armies correctly together during peace
Economy AI
Overall reduced AI manpower target based on size of their economy while also increasing their military budget, meaning they will now have a larger army and less surplus manpower while keeping the cost roughly the same
AI now gradually respects their desired buffer when building units based on how depleted their forces are
Overall reduced AI maximum target for manpower as they wasted money on having way too much compared to their actual army
Fixed an issue where AI would build fleets using up 100% of their monthly sailors, leaving nothing in reserve for reinforcements
Fixed an issue where AI would not be able to buy things when they were saving up stability or government power to get out of disasters, even when the cost didn't include stability or government power
AI is now more interested in keeping stability above 0, reduced desire when above 0
Reduced AI willingness to invest into the stability slider to suppress ongoing rebels
Enjoy, next week we will be back for the last Tinto Talks of the year..

Please fix the "Fill Impassable Terrain" setting—it has no effect when toggled.

Sounds great, is there anything on the current naval combat with ships constantly retreating back a forth between a tile without being destroyed

Some nice fixes but the military rebalance isn't going to do anything. Cavalry is still mega OP because of their damage dealt and initiative, so reducing their damage taken modifier isn't going to do much and anyway regulars are still space marines in general.
Also vassal swarm trivializes all conquests.
Hopefully these can get tackled as part of 1.1 otherwise there's not much point in playing past the Age of Discovery since by then you've already won.
edit: how tf are people disagreeing with this? I forgot that anything critical on a Tinto Talks results in drive-by downvotes. Y'all reap what ya sow.

Great news!
Can we expect changes to naval levies, so that countries wouldn't be landlocked if they have no towns? Currently this makes Polynesia, the Maldives, and other island countries landlocked and unplayable.

When do you expect to be able to assist those of us who still can't play the game because of crashes?

I am not understanding the wording correctly, will 1.0.10 release this week or will it just be the beta for 1.0.10?

I read it as everything he listed is hoped to be part of the go live or beta (not sure which) latest variant of 1.0.10 intended to be released later this week.
I'm guessing it will be an update to the beta followed shortly afterwards (if all is well) with a Live 1.0.10 to be used by the general gameplaying folks over xmas etc
