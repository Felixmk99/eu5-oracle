The Nanbokuchō Jidai situation will start on 1st May 1337. It will affect every country that is part of the Japanese Shogunate international organization. When the Nanbokuchō Jidai situation starts, Daikakuji Court will take ownership of the following works of art: Kusanagi no Tsurugi, Yata no Kagami, and Yasakani no Magatama. In addition, every country that is part of the Japanese Shogunate except Daikakuji Court will gain the Nanbokuchō Jidai modifier, giving the following effects:
−0.2
Monthly Legitimacy
−0.1
Monthly Prestige
The countries that are involved in the Nanbokuchō Jidai situation are either neutral or divided into two sides: Jimyōin Court supporters and Daikakuji Court supporters. Members of the same side cannot declare war on each other. When the situation starts, every country involved will be given the choice to support the side they supported historically, support the other side, or remain neutral.
Supporting the side that was historical will give
+5
Prestige. If Historical AI is turned on, all countries controlled by the AI will choose this.
Supporting the opposing side will give
−12
Stability and
−15
Honor.
Supporting neither side will give
−2.5

+15
Prestige. Kyōto will become its new capital if not already, it will gain a Gosho building, and the works of art Kusanagi no Tsurugi, Yata no Kagami, and Yasakani no Magatama will be moved there.
While the situation is active, there is a 33% chance each month that of the following events will happen:
All countries can get an event that gives them the Nanbokuchō Jidai casus belli for 4 years on a country that supports the other side, unless the two countries have a truce.

−5
Prestige.
Countries that have a casus belli on a country that supports the other side and does not have a truce with them may get an event to decide between declaring war on them or lose
−10
Prestige.
Countries that have
−50
or less Opinion of the leader of their side and
0
or more Opinion of the leader of the opposing side can gain an event to switch sides. Accepting to switch sides will give
−5
Prestige,
−15
Honor, and
−100
Opinion of the leader of their former side. Refusing to switch sides will give
+5
Prestige,
+5
Honor, and
−50

Rise of the Turks
The Rise of the Turks situation will start on 1st May 1337. It will affect
Ottomans
and every country that borders Ottomans, owns a location in the regions of Anatolia or Balkans, or has the Anatolian Beylik government reform.
Every country that has the Anatolian Beylik government reform will be eligible to become the strongest Beylik. The strongest Beylik is calculated by military strength and monthly income, with subject countries receiving a
−25%
penalty to the calculation. The strongest Beylik gains access to unique situation actions and receives the following bonuses:
If any location has the Conquered integration status there is a 4% chance each month to receive an event with the choices to either gain 20 integration progress and change societal values by 5 towards Communalism or gain 10 integration progress and receive 7 Stability.
If the country has 0 or 1 subjects there is a 3% chance each month to receive an event to offer subjugation to a neighbor who is independent, at peace, not a rival, has the same primary religion, has the same common language and has less population. There is a 50% chance the neighbor will accept and a 50% chance to gain the Claims on Province casus belli for 4 years.
If the country owns Kōnstantinoúpolis, at least 301 locations and at least 50 urban locations it will gain the rank of Empire if not one already
When the situation starts, Ottomans will start as the strongest Beylik and will also gain the Legacy of Osman government reform. If another country becomes the strongest Beylik they will gain the Leader of the Turks government reform.
If a country with the Anatolian Beylik government reform owns Erzurum, Konya, Sivas or Tabrīz will gain access to the Trunk Road to Erzurum estate privilege. The estate privilege increases in power the more of the required locations are controlled.
The Rise of the Turks situation can end in 4 ways:
It will end automatically in 1566.
It will end automatically after 1401 if no independent Beylik owns at least 100 locations.
It will end automatically if no country has the Anatolian Beylik government reform.
It will end if a Beylik owns at least 500 locations and at least 50 urban locations, and either they are Ottomans or Ottomans no longer exist. The Beylik will gain the Legacy of Ottomans government reform, and unlock the Pashas government reform and the Eyalet Division policy. If the Beylik is Ottomans they will lose the Legacy of Osman government reform.
Countries that are involved in the The Rise of the Turks situation and have the Anatolian Beylik government reform gain access to situation actions.

The Guelphs and Ghibellines situation will start on 1st June 1337. It will affect the Papal States, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and every country that is located in the region of Italy or a member of the Guelphs or Ghibellines international organizations.
The countries that are part of the Guelphs and Ghibellines situation are divided into two sides and international organizations: Guelphs and Ghibellines. The Papal States will always be part of the Guelphs while the the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire will always be part of the Ghibellines.

All countries that become involved in the situation afterwards have a 2% chance each month to be asked to pick a side.
The most powerful country in each international organization will be the leader and gain access to additional situation actions. When the situation starts Kingdom on Naples will be the leader of the Guelphs and Duchy of Upper Bavaria will be the leader of the Ghibellines. If a country who is not part of the Ghibellines becomes Holy Roman Emperor, it will be asked to join the international organization. Accepting gives

It will end if either the Guelphs reach 100% progress or the Ghibellines no longer exist. Every country with the capital located in the region of Italy that is part of the Holy Roman Empire will leave the international organization.
It will end if either the Ghibellines reach 100% progress or the Guelphs no longer exist. Every country with the capital located in the region of Italy but not in the areas of Apuila, Lazio, Campania and Principato, Basilicata and Calabria, or Sicily, will join the Holy Roman Empire
It will end automatically if neither side makes enough progress before 1437. All countries that are members of the Guelphs or Ghibellines will lose
−10
Prestige and
−5

Every month after the situation starts, there is a 20% chance that a kingdom will want to split off Yuán to form an independent kingdom with the Warring State government reform and up to 8 of Yuán's most competent characters will join the new kingdom. If a human player is playing as Yuán, each time a kingdom will want to split off the player will receive the option to switch countries to the new kingdom. Every kingdom that split off will have an Allegiance to Yuán value, which is visible on the map when the situation is open. Countries that have it below 0% will join Red Turban Rebels, countries that have it above 50% will join Middle Kingdom, and countries that have it between 0% and 50% will be neutral.
If a new kingdom sides with the rebellion it will start with
−100%
Allegiance to Yuán. Yuán will lose
−12
Stability and will declare war on the new kingdom using the Rein in the Rebels casus belli. The first kingdom that becomes independent and sides with the rebellion will be the leader of Red Turban Rebels.
If a new kingdom sides with Middle Kingdom it will start with
75%
Allegiance to Yuán and will join all of Yuán's wars. Yuán can choose to prevent the kingdom from becoming independent and gain
+7
Stability. If Yuán is controlled by the AI and Historical AI is turned on, it will always allow the kingdom to become independent.

The Treaty situation will start after 1437 after two countries with Catholicism as their primary religion and their capital in Europe have colonized the continent of America. Only those two countries will be affected by the situation.
The situation has two stages and a location which divides colonization rights in the entire world vertically between the two countries. The location which divides the continent will initially be the colony of the second country but can can be moved during the first stage of the situation.
When the situation starts the second country to make a colony in America will be asked to pick a location to meet with the first country that made a colony in America, which will also decide the name of the situation. The following locations will be available:

The Reformation
The The Reformation situation has a 4% chance to start each month after 1510. It will affect every country with the capital located within the continent of Europe and a Christian primary religion other than Miaphysitism or Nestorianism. The situation will keep track of the worldwide Lutheran and Catholic population.
When the situation starts the Lutheranism religion will appear. A location in Europe that has an university building and Catholicism religion and is not Rome or owned by Papal States will have 50% of its Catholic pops convert to Lutheranism and gain the Lutheran Preachers building. Martin Luther will appear as a courtier in the country that owns the location. If multiple locations are valid the location will be chosen from a region in the following order:
North Germany
South Germany
Scandinavia
Iberia or Italy
A few months later, if Bern has Catholicism as its dominant religion it will gain a Lutheran Preachers building and Huldrych Zwingli will appear as a courtier in the country that owns the location.
Every month each location that has Catholicism as its dominant religion and borders a location that has a Lutheran Preachers building or Lutheranism as its dominant religion has a 12% chance to construct or upgrade a Lutheran Preachers building and a 8% chance to block further progress there for Lutheran Preachers buildings.
Every month there is a 10% chance for a Lutheran Preachers building to be constructed in the following locations if their dominant religion is Catholicism:
Halle after 1515
Wittenberg after 1517
København after 1520
Âbo after 1530
If a country involved in the situation has Catholicism as its primary religion and embraced the Printing Press institution it will receive an event with the following options:
Spend 5 Religious Influence and 25% of all owned locations with Catholicism as their dominant religion gain a Lutheran Preachers building
Gain
+10%
Pop Assimilation Speed for 25 years
If Basel has Catholicism as its dominant religion after 1530 the Calvinism religion will appear and the location will gain the Calvinist Preachers building. 2-3 months later between 5% and 50% of the Catholic pops in the country that owns Basel will convert to Calvinism and 25% of the pops belonging to the Clergy estate from Paris will convert to Calvinism. 1-3 years later between 5% and 50% of the Catholic pops in the country that owns Genève will convert to Calvinism. After 1534 there is a 10% chance each month for a Calvinist Preachers building to be constructed in Edinburgh and after 1542 there is a 1% chance each month for one to be constructed in Antwerpen.
All countries that are affected by the situation except Papal States can choose to convert their religion to Lutheranism or Calvinism. If the country has Theocracy government it will be changed to Monarchy but incur a Stability and Prestige cost. Converting has the following requirements:
Primary religion is Catholicism
Country has pops that follow either Lutheranism or Calvinism
Fewer than 20 countries have Lutheranism as their primary religion
Fewer than 20 countries have Calvinism as their primary religion
The The Reformation situation can end in two ways:
It will end in year 1700
It will end if the Council of Trent and War of Religions situations have ended
Council of Trent
[

]
Council of Trent
The Council of Trent situation will start after 1530 as long as Catholicism religion has at least 25% Reform Desire. It will affect every country that has Catholicism or Lutheranism as its primary religion.
When the situation starts the leader of the Catholic Church will lose a very large amount of Gold. Laws in the international organization will become changeable. Every country affected by the situation will be able to propose a law change, which will be debated by all members of the international organization.
The Council of Trent ends when at least 5 debates failed or succeeded, or at the start of the Age of Absolutism. It will decide Catholicism view on the following religions: Lutheranism, Calvinism, Hussitism and Anglicanism.
Ending
Catholicism view on reformation religions
>2 more debates passed than failed
Kindred
-2 <= debates passed - debated failed <= 2
Negative
2< debates failed than passed

War of Religions
The War of Religions situation will start after 1590 if there is a war between a country that has Catholicism as its primary religion and a country that has Lutheranism or Calvinism as its primary religion while the Holy Roman Empire has both independent members that have Catholicism as their primary religion and independent members that have Lutheranism or Calvinism as their primary religion. The situation will affect every country that owns at least one location within the continent of Europe.
The countries that are part of the War of Religions situation are either neutral or divided into two sides and international organizations: Catholic League and Protestant Union. The initial leaders of the international organizations will be the countries with the highest score that have Catholicism or Lutheranism or Calvinism respectively as their primary religion. After the situation has been active for at least 10 years the leaders of both sides will unlock a situation action to gain the Religious Supremacy casus belli on the leader of the opposing side for 4 years.
The country that controls Hanau in 1639 will receive the option to gain Johann Jakob, an artist with an Artistic Skill of 84. The country that has Johann Jakob has a 5% chance each month to gain the work of art Magnum Opus 'Simplicissimus Teutsch'.
Between 1605 and 1655 every country that has Catholicism as its primary religion, Czech or Danube Bavarian as its primary culture, and is at war using the Religious Supremacy casus belli has a 1% chance each month to be offered to gain the character Albrecht Wallenstein and gain a very large amount of scaled Gold. If the offer is refused he will join a neighbor country. The country that has Albrecht Wallenstein has a 5% chance each month to receive an event where it must choose between giving Albrecht Wallenstein the Unsuited for Command trait or gain
+3
War Exhaustion and
-15%
Nobility Estate Satisfaction. If Albrecht Wallenstein gains the Unsuited for Command trait he will die in 6 months unless the the leader of either side in the situation occupies Dumbarton, in which case they will gain Albrecht Wallenstein.
If a country's ruler is fighting in a battle in Europe against a country the Religious Supremacy casus belli was used on, there is a 4% chance it will gain the Inspirational Leader trait and a 36% chance it will die but the country will receive
+10
Prestige and
+50
Opinion with every country that has the same primary religion.
The War of Religions situation can end in three ways. When it ends the Holy Roman Empire will have a new leader election.
It will end if either side won a war that was using the Religious Supremacy casus belli.
It will end if 80% of the countries affected by the situation desires peace. Any war between countries on opposing sides will end in white peace. The Holy Roman Empire will lose
-50
Imperial Authority and its religious laws will be changed to Imperial Religion: Christianity and Electorate Religious Law: Only Imperial Religion Group.
It will end after 1737 once there are no wars that use the Religious Supremacy casus belli.
The situation keeps track of which countries affected by the situation desire peace. A country will be considered to desire peace if it meets one of the following criteria:
Has been at war for 6-10 years and War Exhaustion is above 80% of its maximum value
Has been at war for 11-15 years and War Exhaustion is above 60% of its maximum value
Has been at war for 16-20 years and War Exhaustion is above 40% of its maximum value
Has been at war for 21-25 years and War Exhaustion is above 20% of its maximum value
Has been at war for 26 years or more
