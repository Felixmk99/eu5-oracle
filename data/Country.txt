Capital
[

edit source
]
Each country has a capital, which is the location where the government resides. Getting the capital
Occupied
in a
War
can be devastating.
The capital can be moved to any core location provided there are enough goods in the market at the new location. Moving the capital costs 20
Stability and takes a minimum of 180
[2]
days, increased by the distance between the old capital and the new one. The
Gold cost to move it depends on the goods prices in the market where the new capital is located. After the capital is moved, any buildings that required the previous location to be the capital will be destroyed. Moving the capital can be cancelled at any point.
Country type
[

Control
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Each capital, including Vassals and Fiefdoms generate proximity. By default, this is 100% in the capital location which spreads out and is gradually reduced over land and over sea if you own a town with a port building.
The reduction is scaled by % Proximity Loss reduction, flat modifiers and constructed buildings.
This is then modified by your Land vs. Naval societal value to arrive at a final control.
Proximity is then multiplied by 0.75 to form your base control which is then modified by buildings, population satisfaction and if it is a core or not. This is then applied to the produced value of the the location, and distributed to your estates in accordance to their power. This is rounded down.
Example:
You have a
town
with a
temple
in a location of your culture (
core
) that is 4 locations away from your capital. The population is missing goods, and is not happy giving them a satisfaction reduction in control of 13%. The proximity to your capital is 45%.
Your total control would then be 45*0,75(Proximity) + 20(Core) + 5(Town) + 5(Temple) - 13(Low Pop satisfaction) = 50,75 ->
50 Control
The share that goes to your non-crown estates is then taxed in accordance to their tax level.
Example:
The location, described above produces
100
gold in value, with 50 control.
All of your estates; Crown, Nobles, Clergy and Peasants have 25% power share.
Result:
The location produces
100
gold, which is reduced to
50
by your control value.
You have a crown power of 25%, which means that
12.5
gold goes straight to your monthly income.
Your Estates also have 25% power each (75% total), which means that
37.5
gold goes into their monthly income (which they can construct buildings with and loan to you).
This is then taxed, depending on the individual tax level of your estates which is also added to your monthly income. Let us assume that all of the estates have 20% tax. (This is manually adjustable by each estate on the slider setting).
In this situation you would gain
12.5
gold +
7.5
gold (20% tax of
37.5
)
Maritime presence
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Each country has a maritime presence, which reduces the proximity that is lost between sea zones when calculating control. Maritime presence in the coastal sea zones of a market is also an important source of trade advantage. While at peace, each port will gradually increase maritime presence, while a blockade will quickly reduce it. A navy of light ships in a sea zone will rapidly increase maritime presence.
Privateers can be created from 250 Sailors by countries that meet the requirements to hire privateers. Privateers will reduce the maritime presence of rebels and countries at war with. For other countries, privateers display as pirates.
Rebels
[

edit source
]
Please help improve this article or section by
expanding it
with: difference between secession and civil war.
If pops do not have sufficient satisfaction, they will create a rebellion or join a rebellion with the same objectives. If enough pops in a location join a rebellion, the location will join the rebellion too.
Every rebellion has progress that goes from 0% to 100%. Rebellions gain progress at a rate of
0.1%
every month, and the rate is increased if control is low in the locations where pops joined the rebellion. When a rebellion reaches 100% progress, all locations that joined the rebellion will form a new country and start a war against their previous owner. There are five types of rebellions:
Rebels
Pop requirements
Notes
Nationalist Rebels
Same culture as existing rebel pops
Religious Rebels
Same religion as existing rebel pops
Slave Rebels
Slaves social class
Estate Rebels
Estate's social class
Gains additional monthly progress depending on Estate Power
