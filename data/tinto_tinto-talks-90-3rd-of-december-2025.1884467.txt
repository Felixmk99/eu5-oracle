Tinto Talks #90 - 3rd of December 2025
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Dec 3, 2025
Hello and Welcome to another Happy Wednesday.  Today we will talk a little bit about Europa Universalis V.
Yesterday, we released 1.0.8, which was in open beta for a week, where we could iron out blocking issues together, and tomorrow, we will release an open beta for 1.0.10.
What are the highlights of 1.0.10? Well, with about 450 entries in the patchnotes, there are quite a lot of things that pop to mind.
New set of advances for when forming Italy, Sokoto, Manchu, Kurdistan, Malacca and Malaya.
Rebalancing of proximity, reducing some sources, and making lakes and rivers impactful, and roads, when built, now ignore vegetation impact on proximity.
Some buildings, like marketplaces and market villages, now increase market access.
And of course, we are adding improvements to AI and UI, and here are two sneak peeks of new Quality of Life features.
You will now be able to see the production efficiency at every location where you already have a building, so you can determine where it's best to expand, and soon we will add the support for unbuilt buildings as well..
You can also see the total tax base and actual income for each category of buildings in the buildings tab now.
Tomorrow, it's been one month since the release, and how have you guys played the game so far? Well, the suggested countries tend to be rather popular, but there is some interesting analysis here.
Of all games started, here are the most popular starts.
Castile 9.90%
Ottomans 9.63%
Holland 8.65%
England 4.96%
Byzantines 4.85%
Portugal 3.60%
Yuan 3.33%
Hungary 3.24%
Muscowy 3.18%
Brandenburg 2.83%
Naples 2.78%
France 2.68%
Poland 2.13%
Sweden 2.06%
Norway 1.99%
The top 5 most popular buildings built by players are.
Market Village
Irrigation Systems
Marketplace
Lumber Mill
Mason
A quick glance at the estate privileges granted, you do like giving your peasants weaponry. And when it comes to modding, the most commonly used ones are various Cheating Menu Mods, but the Community Flavor Pack is rising dramatically in popularity.

I would not have expected Market Village to be in the top 5!

One thing to note for the proximity rework is the effect that has on war score costs. I've been playing with a mod that equalizes up- and downstream river effects, and the control increase radically increases war score cost.

I'm glad we're getting some kind of update. But I'm missing the part where you ironed out issues. It doesn't look like any serious player concerns were adressed before your released this patch. And the games AI doesn't even know how to deal with the changes that were made.

Can we also see the location building-level cap in the building tab?

oooh yeah I was right about roads and vegetation but no impacton hills/mountains
Impatient to see the full patch notes!
Considering the UI, I hope you had a chance to look at the Better Roads Builder mod, makes building roads and seeing river flow much easier..

I hope that your mention of mod means that you’re keeping a close eye on what mods are becoming popular amongst the playerbase for basegame implementation. There’s a lot of good ideas!
The 1.1.10 changes mentioned will definitely help with some of the bigger issues that I’ve seen recently (particularly the lack of river/lake effects on proximity), so hopefully the rest of the patch notes contain similarly-big updates!

Will there be feedback from the developers regarding the UI mega thread and the suggestions there? Will some of the suggestions be implemented at some future date?

Roads buff is huge for Austria and England IMO, appreciate it! And UI QOL is also cool, but I think research tab needs drag and drop or something like that too.
