Coalitions can be created targeting countries with at least
50
[1]
antagonism. Other countries can join the coalition if they have diplomatic range to the target and less than
−50
opinion and more than
50
antagonism towards the target. Countries cannot join more than one coalition targeting a given country, but can otherwise join multiple coalitions. Countries cannot join coalitions targeting their overlord or subject, a member of their union, or if they are at war with, have a truce with, or have given an Anti Coalition Treaty to the target; countries that have any of those conditions or have less than
30
antagonism towards the target automatically leave the coalition unless they are at war with the target. Countries can leave on their own unless they are at war with the target.
Countries in a coalition gain the
Coalition
casus belli against the target, and all members of the coalition automatically join any war against the target involving another member.
Union
[
edit
|
edit source
]
A union is created when a country's ruler or heir is also the heir of another country due to royal marriage. Any additional country that later has the same ruler will join the Union as well. Members of a Union will join each other's defensive wars and cannot declare war on each other.
Once the same character is the ruler of two or more countries at the same time, the Union between those countries will be expanded with additional mechanics. Every member of a union has an Integration Level, which starts at 0 and is increased if the member is part of the Union when a centralization law is implemented. With the final centralization policy, all Junior Partners which have the same level as the Union get unified by the Senior Partner. Every union has 7 laws: Union Foundation, Mutual Offence, and 5 centralization laws which must be passed in order:
Codified Inheritance
Economy of the Union
Diplomatic Liberties
Legislature of the Union
Question of Unification
The Union Foundation law starts set to the Maintain Federal Status policy. If its policy is changed to Establish Seniority, the member with the highest Great Power Score will become the Senior Partner and the Union will be renamed after their primary culture. Every member who is weaker than the Senior Partner will gain the Union Independence casus belli on it, and every member who is equal or stronger than the Senior Partner will gain the War for Seniority casus belli on it. In addition, the Parliament tab will become available. After any centralization law has been passed and all Union members have been part of the international organizations for at least 5 years, the Senior Partner can call the parliament. This will start a parliamentary debate that raises every member's Integration Level to that of the Senior Partner if it passes.
Catholic Church
[

edit source

Catholic Church
Catholic Church is made up of all countries that have Catholicism as their primary religion. Its leader will always be
Papal States
, who unlocks the Excommunicate and Place Interdict diplomatic actions. The estates of all members of the Catholic Church will pay a Gold tithe to Papal States equal to 1 Gold multiplied by their percentage of population compared to all other estates of member countries. During the
Western Schism situation
, estates from countries that side with Toulouse will pay the tithe to Toulouse instead of Papal States.
The Catholic Church has 7 laws. They cannot be changed unless the
Council of Trent situation
is active.
Papal Authority is set to
Ultramontanism
The Purchase of Indulgences is set to
Cum Postquam
Simony is set to
Beatior Ist Largitas
The Marriage of Priests is set to
In Rito Romano
Veneration of Saints and Reliquaries is set to
Sunt in Regno Dei
Society of Jesus is set to
Dominus Ac Redemptor Norster
Persecution of Witchcraft is set to
Sicut Malefici Aegyptii
The Catholic Church has the Curia special status, which is given to any country that has cardinals. The Curia special status is removed if it no longer has cardinals. Countries with the Curia special status will vote on Papal Bulls. They will vote in favor of any Papal Bull except Excommunication and Call for Crusade, which may be rejected. The voting power of each country is equal to how many cardinals it has.
The Catholic Church has a tab called Papal Bulls, which allows its member countries to spend 50 Religious Influence to start a debate which lasts 180 days. After the debate passes, the Catholicism religion will gain a positive modifier for 10 years.

Excommunication is possible during the
Age of Traditions
and
Age of Renaissance
and can be done in two ways:
Members of the international organization can propose the Excommunication Papal Bull, which must be voted and passed.
Papal States can use the Excommunicate diplomatic action.
Excommunicated rulers gain a modifier which gives the following penalties:
−0.1

Papal States will unlock the Lift Excommunication diplomatic interaction with countries with an excommunicated ruler, and these countries will unlock the Request Lifting Excommunication diplomatic action with Papal States.
Crusade
[

|
edit source
]
An eighth Papal Bull is
Call for Crusade
, which can only be suggested by members who are independent before 1437 or while the Illius Qui Se Pro Divini Papal Bull is passed. Only one Crusade can be active at a time. Once selected, a country must be selected as target. Curia will vote for or against the Crusade depending on their opinion with both the target and the country proposing the Crusade, as well as their relative strength compared to the target. Only countries that meet the following criteria can be selected as target:
Different religion group
Country rank is Kingdom or Empire
Owns any holy site of Catholicism
Discovered by Papal States
Not a subject or overlord of Papal States
Not at war, allied, or in a truce with the country proposing the Papal Bull.
If the Papal Bull is passed, a Crusade international organization is created and every country that voted yes will join it. Crusades have a Religious Zeal value, which ranges from 0% to 100% and increases the damage all members do to heathens in battle by a tenth of the Religious Zeal. Religious Zeal will increase or decrease depending on the number of members.
Holy Roman Empire
[

]
Holy Roman Empire
Countries can join the Holy Roman Empire if they have the same primary religion as its leader and are neighbours of a member of the international organization. Members of the Holy Roman Empire cannot increase their country rank. Antagonism on members of the Holy Roman Empire is increased by 75% and declaring war without casus belli on another member of the international organization costs 75% more. Countries cannot leave the Holy Roman Empire except via a peace treaty with its leader's country.
Holy Roman Empire uses a resource called Imperial Authority, which is used by the leader for enacting international organization laws. It is generated by every member, particularly if they are at peace, as well as by the total abilities of the international organization's leader. It is reduced if members of the Holy Roman Empire are subjugated by countries that are not members, or if locations in the region or North Germany or South Germany are owned by countries who are not members.
The leader of the Holy Roman Empire is a ruler decided by voting. Any country that is independent, has an heir, is not in a regency, and has Monarchy government can be voted, whether it's part of the international organization or not. The current leader cannot vote for their heir unless the Free Electorate policy has been implemented. The ruler of the country that has more than 50% of the votes becomes leader upon the current leader's death. If no country has more than 50% votes, the international organization will not have a leader until one of the countries does. If the new leader is the ruler of the same country as the previous one, the Holy Roman Empire will gain
+5
Imperial Authority. The Members tab of the international organization will show underneath each AI elector whether they will vote for the player country or not. Hovering over their vote will display a detailed breakdown of why they will vote for their current choice. If the leader changes government type, it will trigger a new election. When a new leader is elected the following works of art will be moved to its country capital if not already: Imperial Crown, Imperial Orb, Coronation Evangeliar, and Saint Stephen's Purse.
The leader of the Holy Roman Empire gains

Buddhist Sect
Buddhist Sects are international organizations available to countries that have Buddhism as their primary religion. Countries that have Shintō as their primary religion will also gain access to Buddhist Sects if they have the Favoring Buddhist Schools modifier. Countries that have Eastern Buddhism or Sānjiào as their primary religion can join up to 3 Buddhist Sects, while other countries can only join one.
Every Buddhist Sect has a Favor value, which ranges from 0% to 100% and changes depending on how many members it has and how many locations its members own compared to other sects. Every member of a Buddhist Sect received a bonus to Monthly Prestige and Karma that scales with the sect's Favor. Countries that have Buddhism as their primary religion can pay 10 Prestige to promote or stop promoting a sect, which will greatly increase the sect's Favor. The same countries can also pay 10 Government Power to disfavour and stop disfavouring a sect, which will greatly decrease the sect's Favor and prevent the country from joining the sect.
Buddhist Sects have no leader, and antagonism on members of the international organization is increased by 50%.
