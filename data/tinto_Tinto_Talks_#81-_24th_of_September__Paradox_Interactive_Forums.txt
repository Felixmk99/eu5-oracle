Tinto Talks #81- 24th of September
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Sep 24, 2025
Hello Everyone and Welcome to another Happy Wednesday, the day of the week we talk about our top-secret, ehh. n/m, it's announced and we release it soon.    The Tinto Talks, where we talk about what will be the greatest game in the universe, Europa Universalis V.
Today we will talk about some aspects of the multiplayer parts of the game.  For me personally it is an important part of what makes these types of games enjoyable in the long run, so it's important to get it working properly.
Architecture
In previous GSG’s we only ran the AI on the host, which created a lot of network traffic, particularly when there are many countries or units. In EU5, which is a far more complex game than anything we have done in the past this would not work if we wanted multiplayer to work. Instead we made a code architecture where the AI runs synchronized on all machines.
Hosting and Joining Multiplayer Games
If you are logged into Steam you can host a new game, which loads you into the lobby.
There are two toggles for whether a game is public and one for if you auto-accept hotjoins or not.
So what's the little button next to the “Currently Multiplayer”?
Clicking the blue server ID button copies the server ID to the clipboard for easy sharing
You can also browse for other players' games, or join a specific server ID you have gotten a link to.
One important aspect of this is that you will load into this lobby when rehosting a savegame, making continuing a savegame at a later date more convenient.
Both in the lobby and in the actual game, you will of course be able to chat, including whispering to other players and public chats.
Out of Syncs?
Sometimes things happen when you play a multiplayer game across the world, where a player loses connection or gets out of sync.
These are multiple options that can be done when one or more players goes out of sync with the host.
Which one do you prefer?
Ignore - Just hope nothing bad will happen.
Resync -  The same mechanic as in HoI4, where you can quickly resync the relevant players. This can save a lot of time, with no need for rehosting.
Continue without these Players - Kind of evil, but sometimes needed.
End Game - It's a sign to not play anymore right?
We also have the option to allow a late player, or someone who “accidentally” disconnected to hotjoin a live game! Just like all other games!
Options
There are multiple options you may care about how to set for what fits your groups when playing multiplayer. First of all is the settings that a host can set, for how quick transfers should be, and how many ticks a client is allowed to lag before pausing for all.
Not all networks can handle the fastest transfer speeds..
Also, the host can decide the game rules that everyone had to follow, if missions should be enabled, how black death is working, and most importantly, if it's called Easter Roman Empire or something else.
Pause
We got a game rule for how you want to handle pause in a multiplayer game, where you can have free pausing, or allowing only host to pause and unpause, or allow clients to pause but not unpause.
Score
One thing that is multiplayer adjacent is the scoring system.  It's very similar to how EU4 works, in that you gain points depending on if your country is top 10 in admin, diplomatic or military attributes every month.
We also have the Victory Cards system, which I suspect 0.1% of you actually care about, but is rather important to drive conflicts for the Dev Clash.

How have multiplayer tests been? Does the game run pretty well compared to other PDX games?
Edit: Also, can we expect some features to be added over time or is MP mostly gonna be a done deal thing at game launch?

Amazing how that victory cards go. Yeah our players don't care, but we care for our internal MP's.

hey
@Johan
, would we have the possibility of several players playing as the same country? it was possible in EU4
Toggle signature
my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

Never thought a game that hasn't even released yet would make me feel nostalgia.

This new "reading" mechanic sounds kinda op tbh. I hope paradox will nerf it before release.

Everything here is great!
Could EU5 MP include things like
map pings
, or Victoria 2 style
map-drawing
you could share with other players? Also some additional host QoL tools, like
only the host can assign players' countries
, etc?
CK3 and VIKI3 are famous for how unstable their multiplayer is. Has EU5 done something different to alleviate this, besides a resync feature?

What do you mean "the Dev clash" Do we have one coming!
It feels like the Dev Diary was cut short half way through. Is there nothing else? Not a schedule for next week or even a good bye?

What about differences regarding players:
1) How will the game work if e.g. host have the recommended PC and other players different down to minimal specs?
2) Player count. Did you check how the game performs in like 5, 10, dozens of players? Will it be able to run on like speed 4 or even 5? (How players with lower end PCs will keep up with the host on the high end)
3) What about desyncs frequency? Is it more or less an issue rn?
Btw, nice changes making multiplayer more friendly network environment for players playing from space or somewhere.
Btw2, pls add pings

And we need a opinion to hide some important information like the amount of others troops, to make the game more unpredictable and more competitive.
