The death of King Charles IV without a male heir in 1328 marked the end of Capet rule over the Kingdom of France, resulting in the coronation of King Philippe VI the Fortunate de Valois, a relative from a former cadet branch of the dynasty. However, this claim has been contested by King Edward III Plantagenet of
England
, on the pretext that while the Salic Law of France forbids the passing of the throne to a female successor, it does not forbid inheritance through a female line. As the son of Dame Isabelle the She-Wolf Capet, the last living sibling of King Charles IV, King Edward III might claim the throne of France as his birthright.
The tension between both countries has worsened over the past years, as our hospitality of the exiled young ruler of
Scotland
, King David II de Bruce, has enraged the English court, which supports the rival
Balliol
claimant to the Scots throne. As a response, King Edward III has also recently granted refuge to Sire Robert d'Artois, who escaped calls to face trial in Paris for his attempts to seize the County of Artois. There are rumors that Sire Robert is even encouraging the disgruntled King Edward III to press his claim to the throne of France militarily.
Should relations reach a boiling point, King Philippe VI may require the support of his subjects, although more than one ambitious
Appanage
hailing from the old royal line may seize the opportunity to demand greater privileges, proving a greater threat to the stability of the crown than any invading claimant. The upcoming years will be consequential for the future of France, having to face external English menace and the proud French lords at once. Will the country fall to the fake pretenders, or emerge as the main power in Europe?

The below is
one of many
player suggested strategies for
France
. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players.
France is a
Catholic
Western European kingdom, and one of Europe's strongest nations. Though powerful, France suffers from deep-rooted decentralization, with large parts of the nation maintaining great autonomy from the King. Soon after the game starts, France will face the
Hundred Years War
Situation against
England
, whose ambitious king Edward III seeks the throne for himself. If the player can maintain French strength and centralize the nation, France can go on to become a formidable world power.
