Tinto Talks #82 - 1st of October 2025
Thread starter
Pavía
Start date
Oct 1, 2025
Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will talk about three more generic Disasters: '
Decline of the Empire
', '
Court and Country
', and '
Aspiration for Liberty
'. These 3 disasters pose a challenge for the players to deal with. Let’s start, without further ado:
Decline of the Empire
​
‘Decline of the Empire’ is a generic disaster that portrays the difficulties of ruling large empires in pre-modern eras; we were inspired by cases close to our starting date, such as the decline of the Khmer Empire in the 14th century, the Empire of Mali in the 15th century, and other such cases.
The disaster can trigger for countries of Empire rank that have fallen below 0 Stability and whose ruler or regent commands fewer than 150 total Ability points. In addition, it requires that the state either exerts less than a certain level of average control in its Home Region, varying by Age from 40% in the Age of Traditions to 60% in the Age of Revolutions, or that the proportion of primary and accepted culture pops within the realm has dropped too low.:
While active, there will be penalties on Estates Satisfaction Equilibrium, Bank Interest, and Monthly Rebel Growth:
To recover from the disaster, you will need to recover positive Stability, to improve the Control up to 50% in the Home Region, or to have more than 50% of Primary or Accepted Cultures in your country:
Some flavour events may also trigger, besides the main mechanical effect of disaster - dealing with dissatisfied Estates, and growing Rebels:
Until, hopefully, one day it will end:
Court and Country
‘Court and Country’ is one of our old friends from EU4, which has been reworked and revamped for EU5. It may trigger after the Age of Absolutism, in countries whose Crown Estate Power is more than 25%, or whose Societal Value is ‘Absolutism vs Liberalism’ is at least 50 towards Absolutism:
Note; Court and Country contains many new events, which affect the Societal Value position of Absolutism vs Liberalism
​
While active, the Estates of your country will be less satisfied, and the pops will also be more likely to join the Rebels:
There are two ways of finishing the disaster, either by embracing Absolutism or Liberalism. In the first case, the Revolution may hit your country much harder when it appears, while in the latter, you'll be giving up Crown Power to your estates. There's no clean solution - it depends on which type of country you want to play with during the Ages of Absolutism and Revolutions:
Note; the 35.53% of Crown Power needed is calculated at the beginning of the disaster, setting a realistic and dynamic goal that is tailored uniquely and fairly for each country's situation.
​
As you've seen, there are different actions that play with both the mechanics for Age of Absolutism, and also with those of the Estates:
And there are, of course, random flavour events triggering while the disaster is active:
​
Aspiration for Liberty
​
Another old friend from EU4! Now, in EU5, it may trigger if being in the Age of Revolutions, while the Stability is lower than 20, having an average country literacy of 60, and either by having No Parliament, an Autocratic Parliament, or the 'Absolute Rule' Policy. It will make your country more receptive to Revolution, as well:
It will also impact Estate Satisfaction Equilibrium, or the Stability Investment Cost:
It will only end if the Legislative Assemblies are Reinstated, and having more than 90 Stability:
Note; The stability required to complete the disaster is heavily dependent on your country's average literacy. Higher literacy = harder to quell the demands of the people
And this couple of events may trigger while the disaster is active:
And that’s all for today! Next Wednesday, we’ll talk about a situation,
The Revolution
, and a disaster that may trigger under it, the
Revolutionary Chaos
. But before that, tomorrow we’ll have a new Dev Diary, about
Military and War
; and on Friday, we’ll have a Tinto Flavour about the
Netherlands
.
And also remember, you can

pfft. Clearly these historical "emperors" have just never played PDX games like I have. My empires never decline in them.
.... why does my palace smell like smoke?

Could you make it so the "decline of empire" disaster also applies to non-empire tier great powers?

How hard it is to keep a good stability ? Seems you could technically avoid disaster if you keep it up.
Also is it something we can change in the rule to make it more hard to avoid for the player ? Making for a more challenging run

Is it me or does the decline of empire seem difficult to trigger? Why does it require for the monarch to have bad stats? An empire can decline with an intelligent monarch

So the only way to end the aspiration for liberty disaster is to give in? Really? You can't double down and fight back?

The decline of an Empire should really be a situation. It happens slowly, hiding bad outcomes behind good short term rewards. Building up corruption slowly in exchange for money or favors with the estates that even the player may be tempted to take despite knowing that it furthers their downfall. As the situation deepens, other nations should be able to be a part of it, taking advantage of their decline to snag concessions, territory, or at the extreme stages and in the later game even partitioning parts of the empire. Other nations should be able to accelerate your decline. It should be dynamic and feel like an empire is really in the thralls of a slow decline.
I dont think it should be something that comes on fast by simply meeting some criteria, hits hard, you overcome it, and boom you're back to golden.

I hope it won't be nerfed in the first patch into basically non-existence because of some disgruntled players.

How likely is the player to dissolve parliament, is there any incentive to doing so? it seems that you would only be depriving yourself from useful and interesting mechanics by doing it.

I think the condition shown for decline of the empire ends are different from what you describe : you describe that you need"to improve the Control up to 50% in the Home Region, and to have more than 50% of Primary or Accepted Cultures" and the tooltip says only ONE of these 2 conditions is required.
I'd hope the tooltip is the one in the wrong here.

Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

There are two ways of finishing the disaster, either by embracing Absolutism or Liberalism. In the first case, the Revolution may hit your country much harder when it appears, while in the latter, you'll be giving up Crown Power to your estates.

So, trying to reach 65% for all estates - with a 25% malus, meaning you're actually striving for 90% satisfaction equilibrium in all estates. That sounds like a pretty harsh deal (and not one uniquely tailored fairly for every country, like maybe a country that has a country-specific modifier giving an additional -20% to a particular caste while granting +10% to everyone else).
It would seem better to go for either "make all happy" or "get 50+ liberalism" should be enough, not demanding both to that rather high extent?
Or is it so easy to attain satisfaction that 90% on all estates should be seen as rather normal?

From the tooltip it seems like it's either. Either give in or have above 90 stability.
