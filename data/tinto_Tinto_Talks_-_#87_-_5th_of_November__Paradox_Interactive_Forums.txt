Tinto Talks - #87 - 5th of November
Thread starter
Johan
Start date
Nov 5, 2025
Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinto Talks, the Happy Wednesday where we talk about our upcoming.. Hold on… ehh.. That's wrong.
We finally released EU5 yesterday, the most ambitious GSG that Paradox has ever made, and we developed it together with the community! Currently, we are rather happy with how it turned out, but the journey is not over yet.
So what happens now?
Well, we have an internal process for how to further improve the game, which should help with easing any pain points you may currently have. We based this on what has worked well for us internally to deploy fixes and improvements coming from the beta testers and influencers reports and feedback.
For a while after the release, we plan to deploy weekly updates, with fixes to things that have a negative impact on the player experience, like crashes, or things not working as intended, being prioritized. Our team splits into two or more parts, with one focusing on the short term and the other on the mid-term. The short-term version gets frozen every week, and then a few days later, when testing is done and any blockers with it have been fixed, we can release it.
What does this mean?
Tomorrow, if all goes well, we’ll deploy a new update, which has all the fixes from a week's work, and should fix the most urgent issues discovered yesterday. Now, some of you might be worried, regarding regular updates like this, but we have a very strict policy at Paradox Tinto that any update should be savegame compatible.
When it comes to more long-term, we have been inspired by how the Custodian team works with Stellaris, and we will be working with a split team, where some are working on patches just to improve the player experience, while another part of the team works on future improvements, additions, and DLC content.
Next week, we’ll look at the roadmap we are working on, after the dust of the battle release settles..

Congratulations on the release.
How long did it take you yesterday to start breathing again after 18:00?

I love the game. Why are you trying to make me fail university?
Now, please get the proper fashion and wardrobe changes in the game! I need grown men in wigs with breechers.

Very reassuring. Especially about short term update save compatibility.

I was someone that was very pessimistic about this launch but I have to admit, everything went a lot better than I expected. For a game of such magnitude, EU5 is both playable and enjoyable. Looking forward to bigger and better (UI...) things from the Tinto team. Congratulations.

I'll only say that the game is extremely fun and I have a great time playing it. It has its flaws, but they are minor so far. With such solid foundation it'll become magnificent.

Custodian Team for EU5 is rocking news!
We are officially in for some good decade ahead, fellow map nerds.

I’d like to say it had a smooth launch and I had a great time playing it, but it was rather unmemorable
Mostly because this is a live look at how I enjoyed the game yesterday, 10/10 would get a little too boozy and launch a brand new map game again

Very nice to hear that Tinto is taking inspiration from Stellaris' Custodian infrastructure. While not perfect, it did help Stellaris a lot especiall as the scope of the game increased.

Now that Johan is a Lich Lord, maybe PDX finally makes a fantasy GSG ;P
