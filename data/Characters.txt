A ruler character
Characters are influential individuals that may be given various roles. Each character will have different levels of ability, traits, a
Culture
, a
Religion
. A character will be considered an Admiral if it is assigned to lead a navy, a General if it is assigned to lead an army and an Explorer if they are assigned an exploration mission.
A character who is at least 16 years old is deemed as an adult, allowing it to be given roles as well as marry and produce children. Which roles are available depends on the character's gender and the laws in the country.
Each character belongs to one
Estate
. Characters belonging to the Nobility estate will be part of a dynasty, and all characters who are part of the ruler's dynasty will join the Crown estate. The most prestigious and important character in a dynasty will be the head of the dynasty. If the head of the dynasty is the ruler, other rulers are more likely to follow them. Clicking on a dynasty will display its dynasty tree. Characters who are not part of the Nobility estate may be ennobled, but this costs 10 Government Power and reduces the estate's satisfaction by 5%.

Marriage
[

edit source
]
Adult characters may marry someone of opposite gender. There are three types of marriage:
Lowborn marriage
is available to male characters, does not require choosing a second character, and costs 20 Government Power and Prestige. Characters with the Eunuch trait cannot have a lowborn marriage.
Nobility marriage
is available to countries with the Monarchy, Tribe, or Steppe Horde government type. Both characters must belong to the Nobility estate from the same country. Nobility marriage is not available between close relatives.
Royal marriage
is available between characters who belong to different ruler dynasties. The second country must accept the marriage offer. Acceptance depends on trust, opinion, rank difference, religion, and whether the heir is involved. When arranging a royal marriage, the map will show countries that are valid and will accept in green and the others in grey. Depending on country rank difference and how far in line to the ruler each character is, each country may gain or lose Prestige.
Characters who follow the Catholicism, Orthodoxy or Miaphysitism religion cannot marry if they belong to the Clergy estate.
Ruler
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Every country may have a character as its ruler. How long a character will be ruler depends on the government type, and how the next ruler is chosen depends on the country's succession law.
If there is no legitimate adult character to become ruler, the country will be ruled by a regent until a valid ruler is available. In a monarchy, the consort will become the regent if one is available, otherwise the regent will be either a character associated with the most powerful estate or the overlord if one exists.
The spouse of the ruler will be called the consort. They are needed to provide heirs, but in some forms of government the consort may also get powers. The spouse's chance to become pregnant decreases as they increase in age.
If a new ruler's culture is not the country's primary culture or a culture considered Kindred by it, the country will have to decide between losing
−7
Stability
or
−10
Government Power
. However, it will gain
+35
Opinion with every country that has the ruler's culture as primary culture.
Abdication
[
edit
|
edit source
]
If the heir is an adult, the ruler may abdicate at any point, triggering an immediate succession. Abdication costs 100 Prestige and has the following requirements:
Ruler is female and heir is male
Ruler is older than 60 and has less than 100 total abilities, while the heir has more than 170 total abilities
Ruler has the Sickly Character modifier, while the heir has more than 170 total abilities
If the country has the Military Order reform, the ruler will have the option to resign as grandmaster, which has no requirements but costs 20 Prestige and 5 Devotion.
Education
[

Characters who are part of the ruler's dynasty and have between 3 and 15 years are given an education. The education may be changed at any point, but only if the character is located in the country.

Traits
[

Traits define the personality and behavior of a character under various circumstances. Different types of traits can be earned while fulfilling specific roles, but a trait will only be active while the character is assigned to a matching role.
Ruler traits
[3]
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Each character can have up to three ruler traits, which are active while the character has the role of ruler or regent. A ruler will get its first trait after ruling for 1 year, its second trait after ruling for 10 years, and its third trait after ruling for 25 years.
