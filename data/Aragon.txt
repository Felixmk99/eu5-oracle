The Crown of Aragon stands proudly as a significant power in the western Mediterranean region, thanks to its maritime prowess, diplomatic weight, and flourishing trade networks.
The stabilization of the Kingdom of
Valencia
and the ongoing conquest of the newly-created Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica might ensure its dominance of the seas. However, despite its relative stability, challenges loom on the horizon. To the East, the
Kingdom of Mallorca
faces economic difficulties, and its ruler's animosity towards King Pere IV the Ceremonious de Barcelona might lead to conflict. In the peninsula, the threat of the
Crown of Castile
is becoming more and more real as the
Reconquista
comes to an end. To the north, the
Kingdom of France
have consolidated their dominion over the Languedoc in the last century.
How should the young King Pere IV face the challenges to come? Will he focus on the Mediterranean Sea and rule the waves from Barcelona to the Holy Land? Will he turn around and claim dominance over Iberia? Or will he try to get revenge for the Battle of Muret in 1213, and recover long-lost ancient holdings north of the Pyrenees?
The Crown of Aragon was formed initially from the dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and County of Barcelona (later the Principality of
Catalonia
) and then expanded to include the Kingdoms of Valencia and
Majorca
. From the eastern seaboard of Iberia, the Aragonese have begun to expand its influence across the Mediterranean fighting against the Genoese and Sardinians for domination of Sardinia and sending a branch of the family to rule
Sicily
after the War of Sicilian Vespers against the Angevins.

Historical description

Historically, the Crown of Aragon would continue its expansion into the Western Mediterranean, taking control over Sicily, Sardinia, and
Naples
. The Crown of Aragon would ultimately unite with
Castile
as arguably the lesser partner to form
Spain
. However, under player auspices perhaps Iberia can be ruled from Barcelona with a Mediterranean focus instead of from Castile.
