Tinto Talks #72 - 16th of July 2025
Thread starter

Start date

Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will talk about the
Inti
&
Folk Religions
! Let’s start without further ado.
Inti
​
Inti is quite a unique religion that stands out in the Peruvian region:
As you see, Inti is part of the Peruvian Folk Religions group. We’ll explain how that works further down.
​
Here is the panel of the religion, which may be familiar to you at this point:
The most important mechanic of the Inti religion is the Yanantin, which is a value that can go from -100 to +100. You’ll mostly get penalties if you’re above or below 0, but it gives the most modifiers when it’s exactly and perfectly balanced at 0:
Depending on the gods that you worship, from seven available, you’ll get positive or negative Yanantin:
As you see, the base value is +0.50.
​
Apart from that, the worship of each of these gods gives passive modifiers to the country:
Here we’re using one of those ‘Building Blocks’ that we’ve talked about before, the Religious Aspect, in a way that promotes the worship of a certain god, which has the consequence of increasing their effects - therefore, being one of the ways of balancing the Yanantin of the country:
You can only promote the worship of one god at a time, and changing it costs Stability:
As usual, take the numbers as a matter of balance and WIP.
​
Another way of balancing the Yanantin of your country is by performing any of the available actions:
Note: There are 13 different festivities, with different modifiers; which one you get when you Host a Ceremony depends on the time of the year.
​
Folk Religions
​
Very large sections of the world are covered by Folk Religions, the new denomination of what formerly in EU4 were Animist, Pagan, or Totemist religions, and that we’ve been able to set up thanks to your feedback in the Tinto Maps series:
Due to the huge amount of Folk Religions, we are focusing on the “Gods” and “Religious Aspects” as Building blocks for the Folk religions. We're aiming to have some baseline gods based upon 'spirits', which are based upon natural forces (wind, water, fire, sun, etc.). And then, we have some of the main gods for 'Folk Religious families'; so, as in this example, the country of Benin, which worships the Isese religions, has a number of deities to worship upon:
The Isese Religion as an example
The Gods that are available to the people of Benin
​
And that’s all for today! We will come back on Friday, as we will talk in the
Tinto Flavour
about the
Inca
!
And also remember, you can
wishlist Europa Universalis V now
! Cheers!

I'm curious, do folk religions see other folk religions as 'heretics' or 'heathens'?
Or it does not really matter for them?
Thanks!

Are there any plans for some of the folk religions to receive their own icons ? Or maybe have different icons for folk religions of each region

Where are the
Religious aspects
for folk religions? Or are they the same as for the Inti religion?

I'd like to see
Pachacamac/Pacha Kamaq
added as a god. It was worshipped by the
Ichma culture
in Lima, who the Inca called Pachacamac. The Oracle of Pachacamac exerted a lot of regional soft power. Again, it would be good for countries to start with their historical deities/cults when known.
Yanantin feels like another gamey mana currency.

Is worshiping a deity as a patron God and worshiping all gods equally any different? Like do I get any modifier if I don't do the former?

In the Inti overview tooltip, it mentions that Doom impacts the country.  Is this just an error with the tooltip and it means to say Yanantin instead?

Do the different folk religions give different bonuses, or it's the same for all, but the Gods are named different? Based on comparing Inti and Isese, it's the latter, without the Yanantin, which is unique to the Incans.

Also, seems that
Ogun
was the "totem" of the Oyo empire. I would like to see it added to the Isese religion.
Shango
would be cool to see too, as he was originally a legendary Oyo ruler who was deified.

I wonder: If Religions lose many of their Holy Sites, will their followers be easier to convert?
Let's say Muslims lost control of Jerusalem, Median and Mekka for a lengthy period of time. Would that lead to Muslims converting quicker to other religions?

I really don't get this fixation with adding religious currencies. It might have been unique, interesting gameplay if it wasn't something every religion seemed to have their flavour of, with very minor impact. It feels like the current Paradox design philosophy for religions is:
Religion name?
What can we use for it's currency mechanic? (Religious influence, Karma, Doom, Mysticism/Spiritualism, Yanantin, etc)
I don't feel like these currencies add anything really, and they're all so abstract that I don't think it's unfair to call them mana (Wait for the Polynesian faiths when they actually use the word mana...). Add on the fact that most of them are based on fundamental misunderstandings of the concept they're named after and I suspect they're going to be deeply unsatisfying to everyone.
I like the pantheons, and I'm excited to see the work that went into the name lists for them. That said, I was hoping for a more in-depth set of mechanics, such as including mummification of rulers, the Capacocha sacrifices, huacas, and of course the oracles of Pachacamac and Apurimac. I guess there's nothing here's that's awful, other than another religious currency, but there's not that much that's exciting here, either. I guess this will have to be one of those regions that doesn't get that much unique religious content until post-release, which is fine - but my reception of this would have been better without the currency.
I was wondering if there's anything to represent close-family marriages, but I suppose there needs to be some way to represent that more on a dynasty level than a religious one so that it can be used in the rulers of a lot of different cultures. Hopefully that's covered on Friday!

For religions with a pantheon of gods, is there an event to invite you to select which god to focus your worship on (à la Imperator) or does it remain on the selected god until you proactively decide to change it?

Does the "maximal amount of spouses" modifier" include the "basic one" consort that everybody gets or is just additional consorts? Becauss if it's the former then it should be detracted or just remove the + from it
Also Islamic faiths shoul have those modifier as well in the religion descriptions
