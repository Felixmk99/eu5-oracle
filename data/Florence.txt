Florence
The Florentine domain stands strong at the cusp of a new age! Our republic has stood the test of time and is located in a prime position to take advantage of our region's prosperity and affluence. Around us, rival states and potential allies all make their moves in a bid to influence and expand their territories in Italy.
However, few are as well known for their aptitude in arts and cultural influence as those in our forums of thought in Florence. Under the guidance of a capable administration and an educated population, the coming century will elevate our people and have us shine brightly as pioneering innovators during a time of great enlightenment. Provided we establish ourselves as such, of course...
Florence is a
Republic
that starts as a county in the Tuscany region of Italy in 1337. Historically, it played a major role in the Italian Renaissance and the economic development of Italy. It reached its apogee during the government of Lorenzo de Medici, who devised the Italian League, an alliance of Italian city-states. This alliance established peace in the peninsula, which allowed the internal development that birthed the Renaissance. It also prevented external powers from invading Italy. With his death and the collapse of the alliance, the French began their initial invasion of Italy, beginning the conflict called the Italian Wars.
Florence was the birthplace of Dante, Da Vinci, and Machiavelli, three of the most influential figures of Italian history. At the start of the game, it is in the Guelph faction seeking Italian independence from the Holy Roman Empire.
Florence begins in favorable terrain, is urbanized, and has a high literacy rate, however it is surrounded by other small and aggressive protean powers. It is wise for the Florence player to seek basic expansion to avoid being hemmed in.
During the Renaissance, the player will get an event to become the
Medici Bank
. Note the player is unable to play as both the Medici Bank and the city of Florence at the same time, even if the family governs Florence. The Medici Bank is able to build banks in the urban centers of other powers and offer manual loans to other states to grow its wealth through interest. Unlike the Hansa, it doesn’t own physical land and can’t acquire it, preventing them from raising an army. Thus, for now it is wise to continue playing as Florence and perhaps a mechanic will be added to allow the player to be both the Medici government and the bank at the same time.
