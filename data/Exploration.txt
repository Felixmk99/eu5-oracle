Exploration

Each country can only see on the map the locations it has discovered. Other locations will appear as Terra Incognita. Countries can reveal Terra Incognita areas that are within its naval range via exploration, which costs 100
Gold, 250
Sailors if the area is made up of seazones and 250
Manpower if the area is made up of land. Each explorations has a monthly upkeep of 10
Gold and and requires a character. Explorations needs 270 days to prepare but this can be reduced by the
Diplomatic ability of the character leading the exploration. Once an exploration has started, it will take a number of years to complete depending on area's distance from the country capital and the terrain of its locations. The duration of the exploration can be reduced by increasing the country's naval range as well as the
Military ability of the character leading the exploration. Explorers, which are characters that start with explorer traits, can be recruited after the
Explorer Commissions advance has been researched.
The first time a country with the capital within the continent of Europe, Asia or Africa discovers an area from the continent of America it will receive
+20
Prestige,
+5
Research Progress, and a scaled amount of
Gold.
Explorations can be started either from the Geopolitics tab or by right-clicking on Terra Incognita within naval range.
Colony
[

A colony is when a country has a colonial charter in a province that slowly sends their own population there to become the new majority and take over the location. Each country has a limited colonial range within which it can create colonies.
Colonies are created via colony charters. The cost of creating a colonial charter depends on population, distance, and number of existing colonial charters. The cost is also reduced by
−50%
if a location is owned in the same area or by
−33%
if a location is owned in the same region. When creating a colonial character, an owned province with at least 1000 pops with the country's primary religion and a primary or accepted culture must be selected, which will allow pops from that province to migrate to the colony regardless even if it is not located within the same market. Migration time is increased the further the colony is.
Colonies need the following goods from their market:
0.2 Cloth
0.2 Salt
0.1 Medicaments
0.05 Weaponry
0.05 Tools
A colony becomes fully settled after it has a population of at least 1000 and 50% of it belongs to the primary religion and a primary or accepted culture. The percentage is reduced by 0.5% for each point of power projection the country has. The colonizing country will gain the following options:
Integrate the colony.
Give the colony to an existing
Colonial Nation subject.
Turn the colony into a new
Colonial Nation subject. If the colonizer is a human player it will also have the option to play as the new country.
If two countries colonize the same province, the first country that completes the process gains the province while the other country loses either
Prestige,
Gold or Government Power, whichever is higher.
Colonies can be abandoned but this costs 10 Stability.
Conquistadors
[

Conquistadors are characters sent to conquer land and create a new conquistador subject type country. They are unlocked by the advance with the same name. Only characters who are not married can be made conquistadors.
Making a character a conquistador costs 2000
Manpower and 50
Gold.
Conquistadors can only be sent to discovered areas within the continent of America that are owned by a country with a different religion group. It takes 90 days for a conquistador to travel to the selected area. Once there, the conquistador will lead an army of two Conquistadors regiments and start occupying locations.
