The Iberian Peninsula has been divided since the Muslim Invasion of the Visigothic Kingdom in 711. Should one of the Christian powers be able to unify the peninsula and defeat the last Muslims in the
Emirate of Granada
they can form Spain. Historically Spain was formed from the dynastic union between the Crowns of
Castile
and
Aragon
and the conquest of the Sultanate of Granada and Iberian
Navarre
.
Spain
is ideally situated to colonize the New World if formed by Castile or expand around the Mediterranean if formed by Aragon.
