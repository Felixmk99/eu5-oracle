Kōnstantinoúpolis (5877)
Once a proud Empire that stretched from Egypt and the Levant to Iberia and Italy, Byzantium now faces a period of almost inexorable decline caused by the shock of the Fourth Crusade, even after the recovery of Kōnstantinoúpolis by the Palaiologos. During his reign, Basileus Andrónikos II Palaiologos saw fit to dissolve several key institutions, such as the
Navy
, in an attempt to save the dying economy of the country, while the
Theme System continued to be a shadow of what it was, as the Empire lost territory across all fronts.
His successor, Basileus Andrónikos III Palaiologos, is now faced with the difficult task of safeguarding what remains of our once-glorious Empire. To our east,
Ottomans
have started amassing a large army to wipe out our remaining holdings in Anatolia, threatening to set foot across the straits. At the same time, King Stefan Uroš IV Dušan Nemanjić eyes Thessaloníki and Northern Epirus like a vulture. Meanwhile, our treasury runs dry of precious coin, and the country may yet be thrown into a perilous civil war, as the family of our Basileus conspires with the
Dynatoí
behind closed doors. Can the Basileus lift this once-great nation from the ashes?
Byzantium
, also called the
Eastern Roman Empire
, is a declining empire in southeastern Europe. As of 1337, their holdings are limited to most of the southern Balkans and four
provinces
in Anatolia - one of which is an exclave. They are in an alliance with
Trebizond
and have
Epirus
as a vassal.
