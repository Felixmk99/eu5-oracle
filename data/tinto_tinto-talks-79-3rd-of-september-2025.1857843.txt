Tinto Talks #79 - 3rd of September 2025
Thread starter

Start date

Hello, and welcome to another
Tinto Talks
, the happy Wednesdays where we talk about
Europa Universalis V
!
Today, we will talk about two more Situations that may happen in the Mid and Late Game, related to the spread of Colonialism: the
Columbian Exchange
and the
Colonial Revolution
! Let’s start, without further ado:
Columbian Exchange
​
The Columbian Exchange is a situation that portrays the goods from different regions of the world that were exchanged as a result of the ‘First Globalization’. In our game, the situation may happen during the Age of Absolutism, that is, from 1637 to 1737. Although we know that new goods circulated before and after those dates, we decided upon these dates to make the gameplay and pacing of the different situations smoother, and it also coincides with the spike of ‘colonial plantations’ happening in the Caribbean, the East Coast, and Brazil.
In our game, these goods are divided into two categories, ‘Goods of the New World’ and ‘Goods of the Old World’, depending on when they are present when the situation fires. So, as an example, Rice and Horse are ‘Goods of the Old World’, while Potatoes and Maize are ‘Goods of the New World’:
As you see, you can spread both New World Goods to the Old World, and vice versa, with some money and prestige as the cost. This means that the raw material in the selected location will be changed to the new one, opening up a different economic gameplay loop, allowing you to plant highly demanded goods in the New World, which could be exploited via Plantations and Slaves, while also allowing the plantation of goods such as Potatoes in Europe. An important thing: we've investigated the actual spread of each trade good that can be exchanged, so you can only grow its accurate geographical distribution, which also takes into account the terrain features (climate, vegetation, and topography) - meaning, you can't plant Rice in the Alps, nor Wine in certain climates.
This also makes it a very mechanical situation, with no events for it, so I'll just show how it works today:
Colonial Revolution
​
The Colonial Revolution is a situation that may happen in the Age of Revolutions, so after 1737. It may trigger if you have any disloyal subject with its capital in a different continent, that embraced the Enlightenment institution, and while the Policy for the Colonial Representation Law is ‘No Representation’:
For the Overlord, the Situation panel may show its colonial subjects that are part of the situation, and they will also have actions available to restore the former colonial order:
As a Foreign power, you can indirectly intervene in the situation, with these actions:
Subjects have a somewhat different pool of available actions for the Situation:
Of these, probably the most interesting and different one is the ‘Create Colonial Federation’ one:
We have tons of events related to the Situation, too. And,although we haven’t shown it today, we have specific content related to the formation of the United States of America, which will be triggered by this situation… But that’s all for today! We will come back on Friday, as we will talk in

England & Great Britain

What about 13 colonies? Is it one single colonial nation like in eu4 or there is more unique mechanics to it?

Can you decide to change an Old World Good to a New World Good in a subject country, if you play as the Overlord?

The columbian exchange could probably use a shortcut to the appropriate situation panel to plant new goods when seeing your pops demands (alongside the "expand rgo" shortcut iirc.)
Also, I don't see a reason to shorten the situation since it's extremely mechanical. It'd probably make more sense to open it up as soon as it historically happened, and eventually unlock more and more goods that can be spread as time passes / you research advances.

If I play, for example, Portugal, and I want to plant Coffee in Brazil, will I always have that possibility, or do I need a province with Coffee as its Raw Material first?

my EU5 suggestions:
expanding the Tatar Yoke mechanics
IO-Based short term alliances for targeted wars
Representation of Jewish pops using estates and laws mechanics
Suggestion to harden conquest of small nations
Reworking the Thirty Years War with Multiple Leagues
Suggestion for Northern wars situation
Subsidizing countries grant favours on them
High inflation directly lowers satisfaction

The colonial war situation could also probably use a more individualised policies distribution, maybe as a subset of "representation in parliement", and open up at least one law "autonomy level", where you could give or take certain rights of your colony and they'd get the appropriate liberty desire. A bit sad it's "all of nothing currently".

Can the exchange be automated? If I don’t feel like clicking locations every month? Can I just auto exchange the overabundant RGOs with asked new world RGOs?
