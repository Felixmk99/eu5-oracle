Every
Country
has a Succession Law which defines which
Character
shall be the next
Ruler
once the current one dies or abdicates. Many Succession Laws define a heir before the succession occurs based on the Heir Selection Score of that character, while others trigger an election. Each different Succession Law has its own rules, such as whether an heir may be of the same Dynasty, or if they must belong to specific
Estates
.
Changing the succession law costs 50
